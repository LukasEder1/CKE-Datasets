0,16532,"['Toys R', 'R us', 'toy makers', 'Hong Kong', 'Asian sourcing', 'sourcing giant', ' giant li', 'Fung']"," NEW YORK (AP) -- Toys R Us is headed toward shuttering its U.S. operations, jeopardizing the jobs of some 30,000 employees while spelling the end for a chain known to generations of children and parents for its sprawling stores and Geoffrey the giraffe mascot.
 The closing of the company's 740 U.S. stores over the coming months will finalize the downfall of the chain that succumbed to heavy debt and relentless trends that undercut its business, from online shopping to mobile games.
 CEO David Brandon told employees Wednesday the company's plan is to liquidate all of its U.S. stores, according to an audio recording of the meeting obtained by The Associated Press.
 Brandon said Toys R Us will try to bundle its Canadian business, with about 200 stores, and find a buyer.
The company's U.S. online store would still be running for the next couple of weeks in case there's a buyer for it.
 It's likely to also liquidate its businesses in Australia, France, Poland, Portugal and Spain, according to the recording.
It's already shuttering its business in the United Kingdom.
That would leave it with stores in Canada, central Europe and Japan, where it could find buyers for those assets.
 Toys R Us had about 60,000 full-time and part-time employees worldwide last year.
 Brandon said on the recording that the company would be filing liquidation papers and there would be a bankruptcy court hearing Thursday.
 ""We worked as hard and as long as we could to turn over every rock,"" Brandon told employees.
He put much of the blame on its woes on the media, saying negative stories about the company's prospects scared customers and vendors.
 The Wayne, New Jersey-based company declined to comment.
 The chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last fall, saddled with $5 billion in debt that hurt its attempts to compete as shoppers moved to Amazon and huge chains like Walmart.
 It pledged then to stay open, but Brandon told employees that it had a ""devastating"" sales performance during the critical holiday season as nervous customers and vendors shied away.
That made its lenders more skittish about investing in the company.
In January, it announced plans to close about 180 stores over the next couple of months, leaving it with a little more than 700 stores.
 The company's troubles have affected toy makers Mattel and Hasbro, which are big suppliers to the chain.
But the likely liquidation will have a bigger impact on smaller toy makers, who rely more on the chain for sales.
However, many have been trying to diversify in recent months as they worried about the chain's survival.
 Toys R Us was also hurt by the shift to mobile devices taking up more play time.
But steep sales declines over the holidays and thereafter were the deciding factor, said Jim Silver, who is editor-in-chief of toy review site TTPM.com.
 The company didn't do enough to emphasize that it was reorganizing but not going out of business, Silver said.
That misperception led customers to its stores because they didn't think they would be able to return gifts.
 Now, the $11 billion in sales still happening at Toys R Us each year will disperse to other retailers like Amazon and discounters, analysts say.
Other chains, seeing that Toys R Us was vulnerable, got more aggressive.
J.C.
Penney opened toy sections last fall in all 875 stores.
Target and Walmart have been expanding their toy selections.
Even Party City is building up its toy offerings.
 ""Amazon may pick up the dollars, but won't deliver the experience needed for a toy retailer to survive and thrive in today's market,"" said Marc Rosenberg, a toy marketing executive.
 Toys R Us had dominated the toy store business in the 1980s and early 1990s, when it was one of the first of the ""category killers""- a store totally devoted to one thing.
Its scale gave it leverage with toy sellers and it disrupted general merchandise stores and mom-and-pop shops.
Children sang along with commercials about ""the biggest toy store there is."" But the company lost ground to discounters like Target and Walmart, and then to Amazon, as even nostalgic parents sought deals elsewhere.
GlobalData Retail estimates that nearly 14 percent of toy sales were made online in 2016, more than double the level five years ago.
Toys R Us still has hundreds of stores, and analysts estimate it still sells about 20 percent of the toys bought in the United States.
 It wasn't able to compete with a growing Amazon: The toy seller said in bankruptcy filings that Amazon's low prices were hard to match.
And it said its Babies R Us chain lost customers to the online retailer's convenient subscription service, which let parents receive diapers and baby formula at their doorstep automatically.
Toys R Us blamed its ""old technology"" for not offering its own subscriptions.
 But Toys R U's biggest albatross was its massive debt load since private-equity firms Bain Capital, KKR &
Co. and Vornado Realty Trust took it private in a $6.6 billion leveraged buyout in 2005.
The plan had been to take the company public again, but weak sales have prevented that from happening.
With such debt levels, Toys R Us did not have the financial flexibility to invest in its business.
The company closed its flagship store in Manhattan's Times Square, a huge tourist destination that featured its own Ferris wheel, about two years ago.
 In filing for bankruptcy protection last fall, Toys R Us pledged to make its stores more interactive.
It added demonstrators for the holiday season to show people how toys work, and began opening Play Labs at 42 stores, areas where children can play with different items.

"," NEW YORK (AP) -- The demise of Toys R Us will have a ripple effect on everything from toy makers to consumers to landlords.
 The 70-year-old retailer is headed toward shuttering its U.S. operations, jeopardizing the jobs of some 30,000 employees while spelling the end for a chain known to generations of children and parents for its sprawling stores and Geoffrey the giraffe mascot.
 The closing of the company's 740 U.S. stores over the coming months will finalize the downfall of the chain that succumbed to heavy debt and relentless trends that undercut its business, from online shopping to mobile games.
 And it will force toy makers and landlords who depended on the chain to scramble for alternatives.

It's already shuttering its business in the United Kingdom.
That would leave it with stores in Canada, central Europe and Asia, where it could find buyers for those assets.
 Toys R Us Asia Ltd. has more than 400 retail outlets in Brunei, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.
It is a Hong Kong-based joint venture with the Fung Group, which owns a 15 percent stake.
It also controls Asian sourcing giant Li &
Fung, a major supplier to Western retailers like Wal-Mart.
 A Fung spokesperson did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
 When Toys R Us initially announced it was filling for bankruptcy protection last year, the Asian venture said it was not affected and operated as a separate legal entity independent of other Toys R Us businesses around the world.
 In Hong Kong, where Toys R Us has 15 stores, parents said there were few other choices in a retail market dominated by a few big players.
 ""If you want something like a mainstream toy shop, then Toys R Us is the only place you can go,"" said Ching-yng Choi, whose home and office are both within walking distance of Toys R Us shops.
 ""Basically either it's Toys R Us or you go to specialized and very expensive toy shops that sell, for example, wooden toys that come from very far away countries like in Europe.
"" Toys R Us had about 60,000 full-time and part-time employees worldwide last year.

1,7335,"['nuclear weapons', 'united states', 'north korea', 'Yoon said', 'Park Geun-hye', 'missile provocation', 'last week', 'Hwasong-12 missile']"," SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korean media say the nation's new president will visit the White House late next month amid worries over North Korea's escalating progress in its nuclear and missile arsenal.
 Officials made the announcement to local media, and the trip couldn't be immediately confirmed by foreign news organizations.
There were no other immediate details.
 The announcement Tuesday comes days after North Korea successfully tested a powerful new missile that analysts believe could reach Alaska when perfected.
 Liberal South Korean President Moon Jae-in favors a softer approach to North Korea than his conservative predecessors and has offered to visit Pyongyang if the circumstances are right.
 But Washington is Seoul's closest ally and military protector, and the North's rising nuclear and missile tests make close coordination crucial.

"," SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- New South Korean President Moon Jae-in will visit the White House next month for a summit with President Donald Trump amid worries over North Korea's progress in building a nuclear and missile arsenal, Seoul's presidential office said Tuesday.
 The agreement for the leaders to meet in late June followed a meeting in Seoul between Chung Eui-yong, Moon's foreign policy adviser, and Matt Pottinger, the Asia director on Trump's National Security Council, Moon's spokesman Yoon Young-chan said.
 The announcement came days after North Korea successfully tested a powerful new missile that analysts believe could reach Alaska when perfected.
 Under the leadership of third-generation dictator Kim Jong Un, North Korea has been speeding up its pursuit of a decades-long goal of developing nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.
 North Korea conducted two nuclear tests last year which are likely to have improved its know-how in making nuclear weapons small enough to fit on long-range missiles.
Experts say the ""medium long-range"" Hwasong-12 missile the North fired on Sunday achieved a higher altitude and longer flight time than any other missile the country has tested.
 Also Tuesday, Adm.
Harry Harris Jr., the top American military officer in the Pacific, met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo to discuss the North Korean missile launch.
They said the North's ""unacceptable"" action underscored the importance of the U.S.-Japan alliance.
 ""We now need to apply pressure on North Korea, and Japan and the United States need to coordinate closely so as to apply pressure,"" Abe told reporters.
 Yoon said Chung and Pottinger in their meeting reaffirmed that Seoul and Washington share a common goal in the ""complete discarding"" of North Korean nuclear weapons and will pursue ""all methods, including sanctions and dialogue"" to reach the goal.
The allies agreed that dialogue with North Korea could happen under the ""right conditions,"" Yoon said.
 ""There was a basic exchange of opinions about North Korea's nuclear and missile provocations,"" Yoon said about the meeting between Chung and Pottinger. ""The United States reconfirmed its firm commitment to defend South Korea and both sides also agreed to strengthen collaborative efforts to deter North Korean provocations.
"" A date and other specifics of the summit are still to be decided, Yoon said.
He said the countries will prepare for the summit so that it ""serves as an opportunity for both leaders to develop their personal bond and friendship."" Pottinger later told reporters that the countries reaffirmed ""desires to get the two leaders together quickly"" following a telephone conversation last week that Trump used to invite Moon to the White House.
 ""The state of the alliance is strong and I am fully confident that it will only grow stronger between our two administrations,"" Pottinger said.
 Moon, a liberal, favors a softer approach to North Korea than his conservative predecessors and has offered to visit Pyongyang if the circumstances are right.
He has shown a willingness to challenge the United States, saying that Seoul should reconsider its deployment of an advanced U.S. missile defense system to better cope with North Korean threats.
However, Washington remains Seoul's closest ally and military protector.
 Moon took office last week after winning an election triggered by the ouster of his conservative predecessor, Park Geun-hye, who was removed from office and jailed in March over corruption allegations.
Moon has criticized Park's hard line against the North, saying the approach did nothing to prevent the North from expanding its nuclear weapons and missiles arsenal and only reduced Seoul's voice in international efforts to deal with its rival.

2,16625,"['50 million', 'million users', 'trump campaign', 'social media', 'facebook profiles', 'Russian election', ' Texas Republican', '$15 million', ""Mueller's investigation""]","Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica, a data-analysis firm that worked for President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, over allegations that it held onto improperly obtained user data after telling Facebook it had deleted the information.
 The social network issued a blog post explaining its decision, although the tale is convoluted.
Years ago, Facebook said, Cambridge Analytica received user data from a Facebook app that purported to be a psychological research tool, though the firm wasn't authorized to have that information.
Roughly 270,000 people downloaded the app and shared their personal details with it, Facebook said.
 Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information that it received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports ""several days ago"" that not all the data was deleted.
 While it investigates the matter, Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica's parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories;
the academic who created the app in question, a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Aleksandr Kogan;
and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received the user data from the app.
 Exactly why the handling of this data warranted both suspension and Facebook's unusual public explanation of the move wasn't clear.
The blog post, written by Facebook deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, cited the ""public prominence"" of Cambridge Analytica, called the alleged data retention an ""unacceptable violation of trust"" and said the social network will take legal action if necessary to hold all parties ""responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior."" In a statement, a Cambridge Analytica spokesman denied any wrongdoing.
He said the parent company's SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake ""a large scale research project in the U.S.,"" but later learned that he had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies, and subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan's company.
For the ""avoidance of doubt,"" the spokesman said, none of Kogan's data was used in Cambridge Analytica's 2016 election work.
 Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment.
Wylie could not immediately be located.
 Cambridge Analytica is probably best known for its political work in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.
The company claims to build psychological profiles based on personal details from millions of Americans that can categorize individual voters.
It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas senator Ted Cruz and the Trump general-election campaign .
 The firm is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes.
Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica's role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.
 But the company has also surfaced a few times during the probes into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
For instance, Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who is now cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation after pleading guilty to a felony charge , disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August.
SCL later said that position never materialized.
 Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix also disclosed last November that the company reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the campaign to request emails related to the Hillary Clinton campaign.
Nix said Assange said no.
Clinton campaign emails stolen by Russian agents are one focus of the election-interference probes.
Nix has denied any involvement in Russian election meddling.

"," WASHINGTON (AP) -- A data analysis firm employed by President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign tapped the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, allowing it to capitalize on the private social media activity of a large portion of the U.S. electorate, newspapers reported Saturday.
 One of the largest data leaks in Facebook history allowed Cambridge Analytica, which had ties to Trump campaign strategist Steve Bannon, to develop techniques that formed the basis of its work on the Trump campaign, The New York Times and The Guardian reported.
 Facebook said it suspended Cambridge Analytica over allegations that it kept the improperly obtained user data after telling Facebook it had been deleted.
 In a blog post, Facebook explained that Cambridge Analytica had years ago received user data from a Facebook app that purported to be a psychological research tool, though the firm was not authorized to have the information.

It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas Republican Sen.
Ted Cruz, and Trump's general-election campaign.
 Trump's campaign Saturday denied using the firm's data, saying it relied on the Republican National Committee for its data.
 ""The campaign used the RNC for its voter data and not Cambridge Analytica,"" the campaign said in a statement.
""Using the RNC data was one of the best choices the campaign made. Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false."" Cambridge Analytica is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes, including Bannon, the Trump campaign strategist.
Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica's role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees.
 The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Mercer and wooed Bannon with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior.
But Cambridge Analytica did not have the data to make its new products work.
So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission.
 A representative for Bannon did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
 The company has surfaced in the U.S. probes into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
British officials are also investigating the firm in connection with the June 2016 EU referendum.
 Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August.
SCL later said that position never materialized.
Flynn is cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference after pleading guilty to a felony charge.
 Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix also disclosed last November that the company reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the campaign to request emails related to the campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Nix said Assange denied the request, which came after Assange had said publicly that he had the emails.
Clinton campaign emails stolen by Russian agents are one focus of the election-interference probes.
 Nix has denied any involvement in Russian election meddling.
 Revelations that Cambridge Analytica misused social media data could also be of interest to Mueller's investigation.
While much of the thrust of special counsel's investigation has been tightly held, Mueller has requested that the firm turn over the emails of any employees who worked on the campaign, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal last year.
 Mueller is also looking at the role Wikileaks played in acquiring and making public the stolen Clinton campaign emails.

(AP) -- St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch was critical Monday of store surveillance footage from a new documentary about the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, calling it a heavily edited attempt to distort an incident that occurred several hours before Brown died in an encounter with a police officer.
 McCulloch dismissed the ""Stranger Fruit"" documentary footage during a news conference and released five surveillance videos from the early hours of Aug. 9, 2014, at Ferguson Market &
Liquor.
He said the unedited videos tell a different story than the filmmakers suggested.
 The footage in the documentary ""was clearly an attempt to distort this and turn it into something it isn't,"" McCulloch said.
And he added that it was potentially dangerous, setting off a Sunday night protest of about 100 people that included reports of shots fired and the arrest of a man accused of trying to blow up a police car by putting a napkin in the gas tank and trying to light it.
Henry Stokes, 44, was charged Monday with attempting to cause a catastrophe.
 An email message left with filmmaker Jason Pollock was not immediately returned.
 Brown, 18, who was black and unarmed, was fatally shot shortly after noon on Aug. 9, 2014, during a violent encounter with white officer Darren Wilson.
Wilson was eventually cleared of wrongdoing by both a St. Louis County grand jury and the U.S.
Department of Justice, but the shooting set off months of sometimes violent protests.
 Within days of Brown's death, Ferguson police released surveillance video from Ferguson Market purporting to show Brown stealing cigarillos from the store shortly before noon.
He left the store and was walking on Canfield Drive when Wilson told him to get on the sidewalk and off the street - the beginning of their fatal confrontation.
 The documentary, which premiered Saturday at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, includes earlier and previously unseen surveillance footage from inside the store.
 The footage, which has no audio, shows Brown inside the store at 1:14 a.m. getting what appears to be two drinks from a cooler, then going to the counter and requesting cigarillos.
The clerk puts the drinks and cigarillos in a bag.
Brown gives something to a clerk, who appears to sniff it.
Brown starts to leave but then returns to the counter, talks to the clerks and leaves without the bag.
 Pollock told The New York Times he believes the footage shows Brown trading a small amount of marijuana in exchange for the cigarillos.
Pollock reasons Brown returned 10 hours later to pick up the bag of cigarillos that he simply had set aside earlier.
 It's an important distinction because the police have always claimed that Brown stole the cigarillos.
And days after Brown was killed, they released surveillance video that showed Brown grabbing cigarillos, pushing aside a worker who tried to stop him and walking out of the store.
 Both McCulloch and Jay Kanzler, an attorney for Ferguson Market, said there was no bartered deal between Brown and the market workers.
 ""It's very clear there was no transaction between Mr. Brown and the store employees,"" McCulloch said. ""And the suggestion that he's coming back to pick up what he bartered for is just stupid.
"" The grainy unedited footage, which Kanzler also released, shows a clerk pulling both boxes of cigarillos from the bag after Brown leaves and putting them back on a shelf.
Another worker takes the drinks back toward the cooler.
 The newly released footage also raised questions about how forthcoming police and prosecutors were about evidence in the case.
McCulloch said the earlier encounter involving Brown at the store was noted in a police report released on the night in November 2014 when a St. Louis County grand jury decided not to indict Wilson.
 The prosecutor said that video was never released because the incident did not result in any charges and the footage was ""immaterial"" to what happened later that day.
 Still, the St. Louis County chapter of the NAACP said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the footage that's just now surfacing.
 ""Regardless of what was revealed in the video, Michael Brown should have never lost his life,"" board member John Gaskin III said in a statement.
""If the
(documentary) video is accurate and valid, it is unfortunate that Brown was portrayed internationally as a 'thief' and 'criminal.' It remains injudicious that so many men of color are racially profiled on an ongoing basis and far too frequently guilty until proven innocent in the United States' criminal justice system.

(AP) -- A prosecutor was critical Monday of store surveillance footage from a new documentary about the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, calling it a heavily edited attempt to distort an incident that occurred several hours before Brown died in an encounter with a police officer.
 Filmmaker Jason Pollock responded by calling St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch a ""master of deception"" and standing by the video shown in his documentary ""Stranger Fruit."" McCulloch released five surveillance videos from the early hours of Aug. 9, 2014, at Ferguson Market &
Liquor that he said are unedited and tell a different story than filmmakers suggest.
 The footage as it appears in the documentary ""was clearly an attempt to distort this and turn it into something it isn't,"" McCulloch said at a news conference.

Henry Stokes, 44, was charged Monday with attempting to cause a catastrophe.
 On Monday night, a few dozen protesters gathered peacefully outside Ferguson Market while police officers guarded the store.
 Pollock said there was no deceptive editing.
 ""He's trying to make it seem like I did something that I didn't,"" Pollock said of McCulloch on Monday in a phone interview. ""He's a master at deception, I'll give him that, and he tricked the world for a long time, but he can't trick us now.
Because anybody who sees that video knows exactly what they see.
"" Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old, was fatally shot by a white officer, Darren Wilson, shortly after noon on Aug. 9, 2014.

 Pollock said he believes the footage shows Brown trading a small amount of marijuana in exchange for the cigarillos.
Pollock reasons Brown returned 10 hours later to pick up the bag of cigarillos that he simply had set aside earlier - not to steal cigarillos as police claimed.
 Jay Kanzler, an attorney for Ferguson Market, said there was no bartered deal between Brown and the market workers.
Kanzler said Brown offered marijuana for cigarillos, but the workers refused.
 McCulloch agreed.

"" The grainy unedited footage, which has no sound and also was released by Kanzler, shows a clerk pulling both boxes of cigarillos from the bag after Brown leaves and putting them back on a shelf.
Another worker takes the drinks back toward the cooler.
 Pollock said those actions are not relevant.
 ""I didn't edit the exchange,"" Pollock said. ""I decided to end my scene after Michael left the store because after that it is irrelevant what happened to the
(cigarillos) and it is irrelevant what they (the clerks) did with them.
The exchange is over, they had the weed, and then he decided to leave the store.
He did not rob the store.
"" Pollock said the clerks lied because they didn't want to admit to involvement in a drug deal.
But McCulloch said there was no evidence the workers did anything wrong.
 The newly released footage also raised questions about how forthcoming police and prosecutors were about evidence.
McCulloch said the earlier store encounter involving Brown was noted in a police report released on the night in November 2014 when he announced the grand jury had decided not to indict Wilson, who later resigned.
 The prosecutor said that video was never released because the incident did not result in any charges and the footage was ""immaterial"" to what happened later that day.
 St.
Louis County's NAACP chapter said it's ""deeply concerned"" about the footage that's now surfacing.
 ""Regardless of what was revealed in the video, Michael Brown should have never lost his life,"" board member John Gaskin III said in a statement.
""If the
(documentary) video is accurate and valid, it is unfortunate that Brown was portrayed internationally as a 'thief' and 'criminal.' It remains injudicious that so many men of color are racially profiled on an ongoing basis and far too frequently guilty until proven innocent in the United States' criminal justice system.

4,7409,"['Puerto ricans', 'statehood', 'lost loved', 'loved ones', 'military veterans']"," SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Puerto Rico nationalist Oscar Lopez Rivera was freed from house arrest Wednesday after decades in custody in a case that transformed him into a martyr with supporters but outraged those who lost loved ones in a string of deadly bombings.
 Wearing a black shirt and jeans, the 74-year-old grinned broadly and waved to supporters through a fence at his daughter's San Juan home before getting into a white jeep.
He was scheduled to stop at a federal building to return electronic tags that monitored his movements during his home confinement.
 Roughly 50 people congregated in the streets outside the apartment building in San Juan's Santurce district holding flowers and Puerto Rican flags, some chanting: ""Free at last!"" A group of singers from University of Puerto Rico's choir harmonized as Lopez drove past.
A street celebration was expected to draw thousands of supporters later in the day.
 Lopez was considered a top leader of the Armed Forces of National Liberation, or FALN, an ultranationalist Puerto Rican group that claimed responsibility for more than 100 bombings at government buildings, department stores, banks and restaurants in New York, Chicago, Washington and Puerto Rico during the 1970s and early 1980s.
 The most famous was the still-unsolved 1975 explosion that killed four people and wounded 60 at Fraunces Tavern, a landmark restaurant in New York's financial district.
 Lopez, a Vietnam War veteran who moved from Puerto Rico to Chicago as a child, wasn't convicted of any role in the bombings that killed six people and injured dozens, but those who lost loved ones hold him responsible.
 ""This guy was convicted of leading the FALN that murdered people,"" said Joseph Connor, whose father, Frank, was killed in the Fraunces Tavern attack.
 While many Puerto Ricans support Lopez, those seeking independence remain a small group.
The option garnered less than 6 percent of the vote in four referendums that Puerto Rico has held on its political status.
 Thousands of supporters were expected to celebrate Lopez's release in Puerto Rico and he was to be feted in Chicago later this week.
Supporters also plan to honor him at the June 11 Puerto Rican Day parade along New York's Fifth Avenue.
 A campaign to free Lopez over the years has drawn support from Pope Francis, former President Jimmy Carter and ""Hamilton"" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda.
 ""He has his champions and his critics, but this much is true: He served a lifetime in prison, including 12 years in solitary confinement.
Don Oscar will spend his twilight years on the island for which he sought independence, and this feels fitting,"" Miranda said in an email, referring to Lopez with the Spanish honorific of ""don.
"" Lopez was sentenced to 55 years in prison in 1981 after he was found guilty of seditious conspiracy, armed robbery, a weapons violation and four counts of interstate transportation of stolen vehicles.
At his sentencing, a federal judge termed him an ""unreconstructed revolutionary."" He later faced an additional 15 years in jail after he was convicted of conspiring to escape from prison in Leavenworth, Kansas.
 In 1999, President Bill Clinton offered Lopez clemency but the inmate rejected the offer because it excluded two associates who have since been released.
Then in 2011, the U.S.
Parole Commission denied his request for an early release.
 President Barack Obama commuted his sentence in January.
 Less than a month later, Lopez was released from prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, and arrived in Puerto Rico to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest.
He has been staying with his daughter at her home in the capital of San Juan.
 The United States seized Puerto Rico from Spain during the Spanish-American War.
The island's 3.5 million residents are U.S. citizens and serve in the military.
The U.S. commonwealth receives billions in federal funds but people cannot vote for president and have no vote in Congress.
 Lopez has said that upon returning to Puerto Rico he wanted to spend time with family and create a think tank to work on issues including climate change, the economy and the island's political status.

"," SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Puerto Rico nationalist Oscar Lopez Rivera emerged from house arrest Wednesday and was celebrated by supporters after decades in custody, freed in a case that made him a martyr for some but angered those who lost loved ones in a string of bombings.
 Wearing black jeans and a shirt decorated with a Puerto Rican flag pin, the 74-year-old left his daughter's San Juan home escorted by the mayor of Puerto Rico's capital and New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito.
 A celebration for Lopez in a plaza near the University of Puerto Rico drew at least 1,000 people by late afternoon, some embracing and wearing T-shirts reading: ""Welcome to your homeland!"" Lopez was considered a top leader of the Armed Forces of National Liberation, or FALN, an ultranationalist Puerto Rican group that claimed responsibility for more than 100 bombings at government buildings, department stores, banks and restaurants in New York, Chicago, Washington and Puerto Rico during the 1970s and early 1980s.
The FBI classified the Marxist-Leninist group as a terrorist organization.
 The most famous bombing was the still-unsolved 1975 explosion that killed four people and wounded 60 at Fraunces Tavern, a landmark restaurant in New York's financial district.
 Lopez, a Vietnam War veteran who moved from Puerto Rico to Chicago as a child, wasn't convicted of any role in the bombings that killed six people and injured dozens.
But those who lost loved ones hold him responsible.
 ""This guy was convicted of leading the FALN that murdered people,"" said Joseph Connor, whose father, Frank, was killed in the Fraunces Tavern attack.
 In an interview with The Associated Press, Lopez said he had no regrets about his involvement with the FALN.
But he stressed that ""the issue of violence is discarded completely"" by Puerto Rican ""independentistas"" and he described their struggle as a peaceful one for many years.
 ""Whatever we did, whatever was done, whatever the struggle called for in the 1970s is not there today. We have evolved, the conditions in Puerto Rico have changed,"" he told AP.
 While some Puerto Ricans support Lopez as a sort of patriot and political prisoner, those seeking independence remain a small group.
The option garnered less than 6 percent of the vote in four referendums that Puerto Rico has held on its political status.
 Lopez vowed to soon undertake a pilgrimage across the island mired in a decade-long recession to ""share ideas and promote unity."" In a written statement, he also blasted ""colonialists,"" who he described as local elites who ""helped Washington and Wall Street"" run the island for over a century.
 ""What quality of life do the colonialists offer the people?
All they know how to do is squeeze the last dollar from the pockets of every Boricua who works and sweats for our country,"" he said, using the term Puerto Ricans call themselves.
 Puerto Rico has been under U.S. jurisdiction since 1898, and its people have been U.S. citizens since 1917.
The island is home to numerous military veterans, though Puerto Ricans can't vote for president and their representative in Congress has no vote.
They pay Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes but not federal income tax.
 A campaign to free Lopez over the years drew support from Pope Francis, former President Jimmy Carter and Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of the American musical ""Hamilton."" ""He has his champions and his critics, but this much is true: He served a lifetime in prison, including 12 years in solitary confinement.

A federal judge termed him an ""unreconstructed revolutionary"" and Lopez said Puerto Ricans should fight for their island's independence ""by any means necessary."" He later faced an additional 15 years in jail after he was convicted of conspiring to escape from prison in Leavenworth, Kansas.
 In 1999, President Bill Clinton offered Lopez clemency but the inmate rejected the offer because it excluded two associates who have since been released.
Then in 2011, the U.S.
Parole Commission denied his request for an early release.
 President Barack Obama commuted his sentence in his final days in office, along with clemency for others including Chelsea Manning, the transgender Army intelligence analyst who leaked more than 700,000 U.S. documents.
 Lopez was released from prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, and arrived in Puerto Rico in February to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest.
He stayed with his daughter at her apartment in San Juan's Santurce district.
 He has said that upon returning to Puerto Rico he wanted to spend time with family and create a think tank to work on issues including climate change, the economy and the island's political status.
 The June parade in New York comes on the same day as the latest referendum on Puerto Rico's status, which is to include three options: statehood, territoriality or independence.
 Lopez told AP he believed his compatriots would not opt for statehood and the referendum would be ""another exercise in futility."" He also said in a statement: ""I want to make it very clear that independentistas do not hate Americans as our people are constantly being told."" The island's previous referendums resulted in no action from U.S.
Congress, which has final say on any changes in the island's political status.
In the last one, in 2012, 54 percent said they wanted a change in status.
Sixty-one percent who answered a second question said they favored statehood, but nearly 500,000 left that question blank, leading many to question the results.

5,1525,"['white house', 'TRUMP ADMINISTRATION', 'palestinian officals', 'palestinian leadership', 'statehood', ""Europe's view"", '']"," RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, who spent hundreds of hours on the phone and in meetings with U.S. presidents and secretaries of state in the past 12 years, has tried unsuccessfully to reach out to President Donald Trump.
Abbas and his aides are alarmed by the possibility of being sidelined at a time when the administration is embracing Israel's prime minister who heads to the White House next week.
Here's a look at what's at stake for Abbas and Palestinian hopes for statehood.
 ARE THE PALESTINIANS REALLY BEING IGNORED? In December, the Trump transition team refused to meet with Palestinian officials visiting Washington, putting them off until after the Jan. 20 inauguration, according to senior Abbas aide Saeb Erekat, the main point man for official contacts with the United States.
Other advisers say Abbas tried to arrange a phone call with Trump after the November election and again after the inauguration, but received no response to his requests.
The White House did not respond to a January letter in which Abbas expressed concerns about possibly moving the U.S.
Embassy in Israel to contested Jerusalem.
 Erekat, whose contacts are now limited to the U.S.
Consulate in Jerusalem, has been quoted as saying that ""we have sent them letters, written messages;
they don't even bother to respond to us.
"" In contrast, Trump spoke twice with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone, on Nov. 9 and Jan. 22, and will receive him at the White House on Feb. 15. WHAT HAS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAID? The White House earlier this week denied an Israeli newspaper report, based on a secondhand quote from a Trump aide, that the administration does not intend to have a relationship with the Palestinian Authority, Abbas' self-rule government, at this point.
However, the statement did not say what kind of relationship the White House envisions with the Palestinians.
 A U.S. official said he was given the impression that everything is on hold because Trump hasn't decided how to deal with the Palestinians.
The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue with reporters.
 WHY DOES IT MATTER? A strong relationship with the U.S. has been the centerpiece of the Palestinian strategy for winning statehood.
The U.S. served as sole broker in two decades of intermittent negotiations on how to set up a Palestinian state on lands captured by Israel in 1967. Many Palestinians are disillusioned with a process they say effectively provided diplomatic cover for Israeli settlement expansion and distanced statehood prospects.
However, Abbas has not come up with a strategy that could circumvent Washington.
 The Palestinian leadership is in uncharted waters with the Trump administration and ""not having a relationship with Washington is cutting off their air supply, essentially,"" said Khaled Elgindy, an analyst at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank.
 HOW HAS THE PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP RESPONDED? Abbas and his advisers have been careful not to antagonize Trump with public statements, other than urging him to rein in Israel's latest settlement escalation.
They hope he'll eventually get in touch, arguing that Trump needs to involve them if he's serious about negotiating a Middle East peace deal.
 ""The foreign policy of the U.S. administration is not clear yet, aside from its clear support of Israel, but the administration knows nothing can be done without the Palestinians,"" said Abbas adviser Mohammed Ishtayeh.
 Despite alarm over Israel's recent measures, including legislation retroactively legalizing settler homes built on private Palestinian land, Palestinian officials have drawn some hope from recent U.S. policy tweaks.
 The White House has shifted to a mildly critical position on settlements, saying they ""may not be helpful"" to peace.
There also are signs Trump will not rush to relocate the U.S.
Embassy to Jerusalem, a move that could inflame the Muslim and Arab worlds.
 ARE THE PALESTINIANS LOSING ACCESS TEMPORARILY OR BEING SIDELINED FOR GOOD? It's not clear if the Trump administration wants to coordinate with Netanyahu next week before approaching Abbas or sideline him for good.
 Jordan and Egypt could mediate between the Palestinians and Washington.
Jordan's King Abdullah II rushed to the U.S. capital last week to present his views to administration officials before Netanyahu's arrival and appears to have had an impact on issues of concern to the Palestinians, such as settlements and the embassy move.
On Tuesday, Jordan condemned Israel's latest settlement legislation.
 Interests don't always converge, however, and Abbas has clashed with Arab states in the past.
 WHAT IS EUROPE'S VIEW? The EU has reiterated its support for a two-state solution - of Palestine arising alongside Israel, with the pre-1967 frontier as a baseline for border talks.
EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said on Monday that Europe will keep promoting this message, including in talks with Vice President Mike Pence, who will attend an international security conference in Munich later this month, followed by a visit to EU headquarters in Brussels.
Last month, representatives from 70 countries and organizations said at a one-day conference in Paris that a two-state deal is the only way to achieve enduring peace.
 But Europe was never a key player, with Washington protecting its role as sole mediator.
If the situation deteriorates, the Palestinian leadership hopes more countries in Western Europe will follow Sweden's lead and recognize a state of Palestine;
the U.N.
General Assembly accepted Palestine in the pre-1967 lines as a non-member observer state in 2012. ARE THERE OTHER OPTIONS FOR THE PALESTINIANS? Abbas could take a more confrontational approach toward Israel, something he has been reluctant to do, in part because it could also undermine his hold over autonomous enclaves in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Such steps could include cutting security ties with Israel, a mutually beneficial arrangement because their shared foe is the Islamic militant group Hamas, Abbas' main Palestinian rival.
 Abbas could also seek further international recognition for a state of Palestine.
Or he could submit more material to the International Criminal Court, where a preliminary investigation is underway concerning possible war crimes committed by Israel and Hamas.
 The Trump administration says it strongly opposes any actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace.

"," RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' relief at being invited to the White House is now clouded by concerns he might have to say no to President Donald Trump in their first meeting Wednesday.
 Palestinians fear Trump will ask Abbas to halt stipends for families of Palestinians killed or jailed in the context of the conflict with Israel, and a senior U.S. official said Tuesday that such a request was raised in preparatory talks with Palestinian officials.
Israel considers such payments a reward for terrorists, but stopping them seems untenable to Abbas, especially at a time of broad Palestinian support for a mass hunger strike of prisoners held by Israel.
 WHY IS THE MEETING IMPORTANT? A solid relationship with the U.S. forms the core of Abbas' strategy of setting up a Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, lands Israel captured in 1967.
The 82-year-old leader has stuck to this approach despite repeated failures of U.S.-led negotiations with Israel and growing doubts that a partition remains possible as Israeli settlements gobble up more occupied territory.
 Trump ignored the Palestinians early in his presidency, while appearing to side with Israel on key issues.
Being shunned by the U.S. would undercut Abbas' remaining political legitimacy just as polls show two-thirds of Palestinians want him to resign.
Abbas has been in power since 2005, and new elections were blocked partly because of a rivalry with the Hamas militant group.
 --- WHAT DOES ABBAS WANT? Trump seems eager to broker an Israeli-Palestinian deal - and some hold out hope that his freewheeling style might succeed where more orthodox diplomacy has failed.
 The U.S. official said Tuesday that Trump will seek a commitment from Abbas to help move peace efforts forward and will lay out expectations for Palestinian actions that could help create a climate conducive to making progress.
He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly preview the meeting.
 Abbas aides say he will try to win Trump's support for an Arab League peace plan offering Israel normalization with the Arab and Muslim world if it allows a Palestinian state along the 1967 lines.
The plan was reaffirmed in March at an Arab summit and would block efforts by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to seek normalization with some Arab countries ahead of a Palestinian deal.
 Abbas will also argue that Israeli economic gestures toward the Palestinians, recently encouraged by the U.S., are no alternative to negotiations on a two-state solution.
 --- AN ABBAS-NETANYAHU MEETING? Wide gaps between Abbas and Netanyahu on the framework of a future deal have prevented serious negotiations since the Israeli leader came to power in 2009.
If pressed, Abbas might reluctantly agree to a one-off meeting with Netanyahu, Palestinian officials suggest.
 Prospects for renewed talks are sketchy, though.
The Trump administration previously tried to win a commitment from Netanyahu to curb settlement building on lands sought for a Palestinian state;
some 600,000 Israelis already live in occupied territory, and construction continues.
Netanyahu reportedly agreed only to a vague slowdown.
 A White House official said that while the existence of settlements is not an impediment to peace, ""further unrestrained settlement activity"" does not help advance peace.
The administration believes a solution cannot be imposed on the two sides, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the meeting's aims.
 --- WHAT DOES ISRAEL WANT? Israel has pressed demands that Abbas halt monthly stipends for the families of thousands of Palestinians killed or jailed as part of the conflict, including those who killed or wounded Israelis.
 ""How can you speak about peace with Israel while you finance murderers who shed the blood of innocent Israelis at every opportunity?"" Netanyahu asked in a speech this week.
 The U.S. official said Tuesday that the issue came up in talks with senior Palestinian officials, with the administration asking that the payments be halted.
He said the issue will be a focus during Abbas' visit.
 Earlier Tuesday, three Republican senators urged a halt to such payments in a letter that reflected widespread opinion on the Hill.
 Palestinians see the stipends as welfare payments to victims of the occupation.
While they are split on whether violence is effective or acceptable, Palestinians overwhelmingly view anyone killed in conflict with Israel, including attackers, as freedom fighters.
A hunger strike of 870 Palestinian prisoners, in its third week, enjoys wall-to-wall support in the West Bank, where a solidarity rally is planned Wednesday.
 Abbas adviser Nabil Shaath said the Palestinian leader cannot budge on the issue.
 --- DOES ABBAS SPEAK FOR ALL PALESTINIANS? The Hamas takeover of Gaza led to the formation of rival Palestinian governments- the Islamic militants run the seaside strip, from which Israel withdrew troops and settlers in 2005, while Abbas administers autonomous enclaves in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
 A decade and several failed reconciliation attempts later, Abbas has been stepping up financial pressure in recent weeks, slashing wage and aid payments to Gaza.
With this tough new approach, Abbas can tell Trump that he has leverage and is ready to use it against Hamas.
 Hamas routinely portrays Abbas' efforts to reach statehood through U.S.-brokered negotiations with Israel as a waste of time.
Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said this week that Abbas markets an illusion and lacks legitimacy to represent the Palestinian people.
 A new political manifesto released by Hamas on Monday, after years of internal debate, seems to harden the ideological divide.
The document was billed as more pragmatic than Hamas' fiery founding charter, and for the first time refers to the possibility of a state on the 1967 lines - but it still refers repeatedly to an ultimate goal of ""liberation"" of all historical Palestine, including what is now Israel.

7,8370,"['removed 92', '92 million', 'million videos', 'share encrypted', 'encrypted information', 'encrypted data', 'tech companies', 'law enforcement']"," DETROIT (AP) -- In the wake of Britain's third major attack in three months, Prime Minister Theresa May called on internet companies to do more to block extremist groups who use the web to recruit members and send coded messages.
 Here's a look at terrorism on the web, what's being done to stop it and what could come next.
 Q.
What are technology companies doing to make sure extremist videos and other terrorist content doesn't spread across the internet? A.
Internet companies use technology plus teams of human reviewers to flag and remove posts from people who engage in terrorist activity or express support for terrorism.
Google, for example, says it employs thousands of people to fight abuse on its platforms.
 Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube late last year teamed up to create a shared industry database of unique digital fingerprints for images and videos that are produced by or support terrorist organizations.
Those fingerprints help the companies more quickly identify and remove terrorist content on the web.
After the terror attack on Westminster Bridge in London in March, Google and other tech companies also agreed to form a joint group to accelerate anti-terrorism efforts.
 Twitter says in the last six months of 2016, it suspended a total of 376,890 accounts for violations related to the promotion of terrorism.
Three-quarters of those were found through Twitter's internal tools;
just 2 percent were taken down because of government requests, the company says.
 Facebook says it alerts law enforcement if it sees a threat of an imminent attack or harm to someone.
It also seeks out potential terrorist accounts by tracing the ""friends"" of an account that has been removed for terrorism.
 Q.
What are technology companies refusing to do when it comes to terrorist content? A.
After the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, and again after the Westminster Bridge attack, the U.S. and U.K. governments sought access to encrypted - or password-protected - communication between the terrorists who carried out the attack.
In both cases, the tech companies involved - Apple and WhatsApp - refused, although the governments eventually managed to go around the companies and get the information they wanted.
 Tech companies say encryption is vital and compromising it won't just stop terrorists.
Encryption also protects bank accounts, credit card transactions and all kinds of other information that people want to keep private.
But others - including former FBI Director James Comey and Democratic Sen.
Dianne Feinstein of California - have argued that the inability to access encrypted data is a threat to security.
Feinstein has introduced a bill to give the government so-called ""back door"" access to encrypted data.
 Q.
Shouldn't tech companies be forced to share encrypted information if it could protect national security? A.
Richard Forno, who directs the graduate cybersecurity program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, said weakening encryption won't make people safer.
Terrorists will simply take their communications deeper underground by developing their own cyber channels or even reverting to paper notes sent by couriers, he said.
 ""It's playing whack-a-mole,"" he said. ""The bad guys are not constrained by the law.
That's why they're bad guys.
"" But Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business at the University of Michigan, says society has sometimes determined that, in times of war, the government can intrude in ways it might not normally.
He imagines a system where law enforcement would have to ask a judge for a warrant to retrieve encrypted information.
 ""If we get to the point where we say, 'Privacy is not as important as staying alive,' I think there will be some setup which will allow the government to breach privacy,"" he said.
 Q.
Is it really the tech companies' job to police the internet and remove content? A.
Tech companies have accepted that this is part of their mission.
In a Facebook post earlier this year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was developing artificial intelligence so its computers can tell the difference between news stories about terrorism and terrorist propaganda.
""This is technically difficult as it requires building AI that can read and understand news, but we need to work on this to help fight terrorism worldwide,"" Zuckerberg said.
 But Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, says blaming Facebook or Google for the spread of terrorism is like blaming the mail system or the phone company for Irish Republican Army violence 30 years ago.
Anderson says instead of working together to censor the internet, governments and companies should focus on working together to share information more quickly.
 Former Secretary of State John Kerry also worries about placing too much blame on the internet instead of the underlying causes of violence.
 ""The bottom line is that in too many places, in too many parts of the world, you've got a large gap between governance and people and between the opportunities those people have,"" Kerry said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""
"," DETROIT (AP) -- In the wake of Britain's third major attack in three months, Prime Minister Theresa May called on governments to form international agreements to prevent the spread of extremism online.
 Here's a look at extremism on the web, what's being done to stop it and what could come next.
 Q.
What are technology companies doing to make sure extremist videos and other terrorist content doesn't spread across the internet? A.
Internet companies use technology plus teams of human reviewers to flag and remove posts from people who engage in extremist activity or express support for terrorism.
 Google, for example, says it employs thousands of people to fight abuse on its platforms.
Google's YouTube service removes any video that has hateful content or incites violence, and its software prevents the video from ever being reposted.
YouTube says it removed 92 million videos in 2015;
1 percent were removed for terrorism or hate speech violations.
 Facebook, Microsoft, Google and Twitter teamed up late last year to create a shared industry database of unique digital fingerprints for images and videos that are produced by or support extremist organizations.
Those fingerprints help the companies identify and remove extremist content.
After the attack on Westminster Bridge in London in March, tech companies also agreed to form a joint group to accelerate anti-terrorism efforts.

just 2 percent were taken down because of government requests, the company says.
 Facebook says it alerts law enforcement if it sees a threat of an imminent attack or harm to someone.
It also seeks out potential extremist accounts by tracing the ""friends"" of an account that has been removed for terrorism.
 Q.
Why are technology companies clashing with governments over extremist communications? A.
Since Edward Snowden's 2013 disclosures about National Security Agency surveillance, several tech companies have started encrypting - that is, scrambling them to thwart spies - instant messages and other data so tightly that even the companies can't read them.
Governments are not happy about that.
 After the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, and again after the Westminster Bridge attack, the U.S. and U.K. governments sought access to encrypted messages exchanged by extremists who carried out the attacks.
Apple and Facebook's WhatsApp refused, noting that they didn't hold the keys needed to unscramble such messages.
Both governments eventually found other ways to get the information they wanted.
 Some in government - including former FBI Director James Comey and Democratic Sen.
Dianne Feinstein of California - have argued that the inability to access encrypted data is a threat to security.
Feinstein has introduced a bill to force companies to give the government so-called ""backdoor"" access to encrypted data so that investigators could read messages on these services.
 Q.
Shouldn't tech companies be forced to share encrypted information if it could protect national security? A.
Weakening encryption won't make people safer, says Richard Forno, who directs the graduate cybersecurity program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
Terrorists will simply take their communications deeper underground by developing their own cyber channels or even reverting to paper notes sent by couriers, he said.
 ""It's playing whack-a-mole,"" he said. ""The bad guys are not constrained by the law.
That's why they're bad guys.
"" Building backdoors into encryption could also weaken it in ways that hackers, criminals and foreign agents could exploit.
That could potentially jeopardize all sorts of vital data, from personal communications and documents to bank accounts, credit card transactions, medical history and other information that people want to keep private.
 But Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business at the University of Michigan, says society has sometimes determined that the government can intrude in ways it might not normally, as in times of war.
He says laws may eventually be passed requiring companies to share encrypted data if police obtain a warrant from a judge.
 ""If we get to the point where we say, 'Privacy is not as important as staying alive,' I think there will be some setup which will allow the government to breach privacy,"" he said.
 Q.
Is it really the tech companies' job to police the internet and remove content? A.
Tech companies have accepted that this is part of their mission.
In a Facebook post earlier this year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was developing artificial intelligence so its computers can tell the difference between news stories about terrorism and terrorist propaganda.
""This is technically difficult as it requires building AI that can read and understand news, but we need to work on this to help fight terrorism worldwide,"" Zuckerberg said.
 But Gordon says internet companies may not go far enough, since they need users in order to sell ads.
 ""Think of the hateful stuff that is said.
How do you draw the line?
And where the line gets drawn determines how much money they make,"" he said.
 Others say the focus on tech companies and their responsibilities is misplaced.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, says blaming Facebook or Google for the spread of terrorism is like blaming the mail system or the phone company for Irish Republican Army violence 30 years ago.
Instead of working together to censor the internet, Anderson says, governments and companies should work together to share information more quickly.
 Former Secretary of State John Kerry also worries about placing too much blame on the internet instead of the underlying causes of violence.
 ""The bottom line is that in too many places, in too many parts of the world, you've got a large gap between governance and people and between the opportunities those people have,"" Kerry said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

8,15397,"['31, 2018', 'united states', 'Quarterly progress']"," WASHINGTON (AP) -- The railroad industry is downplaying expectations that a safety technology that could have prevented recent deadly train crashes will be in operation across the country by the end of the year.
 Indeed, freight and commuter rail officials speak as if there never was any plan to complete their work on the technology known as positive train control, or PTC, by Dec. 31. Congress required in 2008 that railroads adopt PTC and gave them seven years to do the job.
When it became clear that wasn't enough, Congress gave them another three years.
The discussion at the time was that a few railroads might need even more than three extra years, and provisions were added to the legislation to allow railroads that showed substantial progress, but couldn't meet the new deadline of Dec. 31, 2018, the ability to obtain extensions of up to two additional years.
 Officials for the trade associations representing the seven major freight railroads operating in the U.S. and the nation's commuter railroads now say they view Dec. 31 as the date by which railroads must meet several PTC milestones to qualify for an extension rather than the ultimate deadline.
 The Transportation Department has little choice but to grant the extensions as long as railroads meet the milestones, said Kathryn Kirmayer, the Association of American Railroads' general counsel.
One milestone is that freight railroads have PTC in operation on half their route miles where it's required.
 ""By the end of 2020 is the absolute deadline everybody has to have it installed and implemented, which means operating everywhere they are required to have it operating,"" she said.
 Members of Congress expressed frustration that railroads appear to be backing off this year's deadline.
 Congress never intended the extensions be used ""to allow railroads that have dragged their feet to just blow off the mandate,"" said Rep.
Peter DeFazio of Oregon, the House transportation committee's senior Democrat.
Sen.
Bill Nelson of Florida, the Senate commerce committee's senior Democrat, said, ""Every railroad should be taking the recent deadly train accidents seriously and doing everything they can to meet the 2018 deadline."" Quarterly progress reports filed with the Federal Railroad Administration show some railroads have nearly completed their work, while others have made little progress.
 Randy Clarke, the American Public Transportation Association's vice president for operations, said three or four of the nation's 27 commuter railroads have already received extensions past Dec. 31 and more extensions are expected.
 ""We are actively working as an industry to get everyone to the milestones necessary for extension or to completion,"" he said.
""We know not every agency is in the same place and some have more complications than others."" The National Transportation Safety Board has said the technology could have prevented a collision between an Amtrak train and an out-of-service CSX freight train on Sunday near Cayce, South Carolina, and the derailment of an Amtrak train in December near Olympia, Washington.
Five people were killed and dozens more injured in the two crashes.
 Amtrak has said it will complete its work on PTC by the end of the year, but its trains often operate on tracks owned by other railroads like the CSX.
 Sarah Feinberg, who led the railroad administration under President Barack Obama, drew a distinction between large freight railroads and smaller commuter railroads that often struggle for funds.
 ""The freight industry should be embarrassed by the way they've approached the PTC mandate and deadline, and the Congress should be embarrassed for letting them get away with it,"" she said.
 But industry officials said the obstacles to developing PTC systems are under appreciated.
It took many years just for the railroad administration to develop standards and then to approve systems that meet those standards, Clarke said.
 Despite some federal aid, commuter railroads have had a hard time scraping up the money to pay for the technology.
 ""We're public transit agencies.
It's not like we have a surplus of money lying around,"" he said.
 Mike Rush, vice president of freight rail group, estimated that freight railroads will ultimately spend $10 billion implementing PTC, and commuter railroads about $3 billion.
 Other challenges have included acquiring wireless spectrum, taking locomotives out of service to install hardware and software, installing communications towers along tracks, and competing with other railroads for the services of the handful of specialized contractors able to install the systems, Clarke said.

9,17354,"['Researcher Autumn', 'Autumn Stroup', 'city regulations', 'Transgender activists', 'public accommodations', 'accommodations laws', 'tracking city']"," ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Voters in Alaska's largest city are on track to becoming the first in the U.S. to defeat a so-called bathroom bill in a referendum that asked them to require people using public bathrooms and locker rooms consistent with their gender at birth.
 The initiative asked Anchorage's voters to repeal part of an ordinance passed in 2015 that prevented discrimination based on sexual orientation which said people could use public bathrooms and locker rooms ""consistent with their gender identity."" The proposition sought to mandate that people could only use the municipal bathrooms and locker rooms that corresponded to their gender at birth.
 Voting by mail and in person ended on April 3 and the repeal effort was losing 53-47 percent as of Monday, with nearly 78,000 votes counted and only several hundred to be counted when tallying ends on Friday.
Supporters of the referendum have conceded defeat and opponents are claiming victory.
 Among those celebrating was Lillian Lennon, who was 14 when her parents sent her from Alaska to Utah for residential therapy, where conversion therapy was practiced and the transgender teen was placed in a boy's dorm.
 ""I was forced to go by pronouns and a name I didn't identify with, and was regularly harassed and bullied for who I was and simply not being able to be known as myself,"" she said.
 Lennon took the semester off from the University of Alaska Anchorage to campaign against the initiative, and said her parents spoke out against it.
 ""I wasn't able to live my life fully, and I absolutely would not want anyone under any circumstances to have to go through what I had to go through,"" Lennon said.
 After the result's final tally emerges and it is certified next week, Anchorage will hold the distinction of being the first U.S. voting jurisdiction to defeat such an effort in a stand-alone ballot measure, said Alex Morash, spokesman for the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund.
 The issue of transgender bathroom access moved into the national spotlight in 2015, after the Houston City Council adopted a nondiscrimination ordinance that included protections for transgender people using restrooms based on gender identity.
 Opponents of the ordinance gathered enough signatures for a repeal referendum, then mounted a campaign using the slogan ""No Men in Women's Bathrooms.
"" By a margin of 61 percent to 39 percent, the anti-bias ordinance was repealed.
 In Massachusetts, voters will be asked in November whether they want to repeal a 2016 state law barring discrimination on the basis of gender identity in public accommodations, including allowing transgender people to use bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond to their gender identities.
 The Anchorage proposition was filed by Jim and Kim Minnery and their group, Alaska Family Action.
 While conceding defeat, Jim Minnery said ""we're encouraged that 47 percent of the people in Anchorage didn't buy into the $1 million infusion that the outside LGBT activist groups poured into the city.
"" Groups opposed to his effort reported receiving about $826,000 in donations while Minnery's campaign effort, Yes on 1 Protect Our Privacy, raised nearly $140,000. With Alaska's economy emerging from a recession, influential city groups were wary about a possible economic backlash if the repeal was successful.
 That happened in North Carolina in 2016 after state lawmakers passed a bathroom bill and the NCAA and NBA pulled games from the state.
An Associated Press analysis conducted before lawmakers rolled back the restrictions found the law would cost the state more than $3.76 billion in lost business over a dozen years.
 In Alaska, those against the bathroom bill included oil company BP, the Wells Fargo Bank and Visit Anchorage, which represents the city's tourism industry.
 ""The experience of North Carolina seems to be a pretty good case study on the national reaction, kind of significant and fairly united national reaction to this kind of ordinance or law or proposition,"" said John Kauffman, an Anchorage lawyer who campaigned against the measure.
 Anchorage is much more isolated than North Carolina and the bathroom measure could have hurt the city, he said.
 ""Just from a purely economic standpoint, it seems like a really bad idea,"" Kauffman said of the proposition.
 The LGBT community has seen a series of wins over the years, from more lenient policies allowing gays to openly serve in the military to legalized same-sex marriage.
Most were focused on the lesbian, gay and bisexual part of the acronym, said Jeremy Goldbach, an associate professor of social work at the University of Southern California who specializes in LGBT issues.
 There has been criticism from the transgender community that the ""T'' gets left off, he said.
 ""I think that has given room and rise to these bills like in North Carolina and these proposals trying to come out of Alaska,"" he said.

(AP) -- In southwest Pennsylvania, Democratic congressional hopeful Conor Lamb hammers the new Republican tax law as a gift to corporations and the wealthy that will add to the national debt and give the GOP-led Congress an excuse to gut Social Security and Medicare.
 Rick Saccone, Lamb's opponent in the 18th Congressional District that wraps around Pittsburgh, says the sweeping tax changes will goose the economy and give Americans bigger paychecks.
National Republican groups, meanwhile, are blanketing television stations here with ads to tell voters that Lamb simply doesn't want them to have lower taxes.
 It's a defining fault line ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, and the outcome for Lamb could serve as a guidepost for Democrats as they try to reclaim a House majority this November.
 Democrats must flip at least 24 GOP-held seats to regain a majority, and the Pennsylvania seat - in a district Trump won by almost 20 points in 2016 - would be an unexpected boost.
 The emphasis being placed on taxes ahead of the March 13 special election here also may remind the power players in Washington that the midterm elections will not revolve exclusively around the tempests that regularly consume the nation's capital - the Russia investigations, a lingering immigration stalemate, the occasional government shutdown.
The November outcome will turn as much or more on voters' fundamental impressions about how Congress is affecting their wallets, now and in the future.
 ""Voters care about the economy and health care,"" Lamb said in an interview the same day Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi spent eight hours on the House floor to emphasize Democratic support for young immigrants threatened with deportation.
 But as Lamb tries to make his race about those bread-and-butter matters, he's getting hammered by Republicans.
 The GOP's House campaign committee has aired a television ad hailing Saccone as a faithful tax cutter and accusing Lamb of using ""the same crummy words"" as Pelosi to decry the tax bill.
Pelosi has mocked some U.S. corporations for giving employees one-time bonuses after the tax cuts;
she called them ""crumbs"" in comparison to benefits for many large businesses and their executives.
 Lamb doesn't say bonuses or wage hikes are crumbs, but he calls the tax law a ""betrayal"" of middle-class households.
 ""It's great we got tax relief for the working class and middle class, too, but we could have had that without adding a penny to the national debt,"" the former federal prosecutor told about 150 voters at a recent campaign stop.
 He said Republicans had to ""give tax relief to their donors, to the 1 percent and big corporations,"" while setting up Speaker Paul Ryan's long-term aims of limiting the price tag of Medicare and Social Security.
 ""Paul Ryan came out and said it the very next day,"" Lamb said, referring to Ryan's comments after Congress passed the tax law.
The speaker told a Denver radio station, ""We're going to have to get back next year at entitlement reform.
"" Saccone, 59, is keeping his argument plain.
 ""Tax cuts, lower regulations and smaller government"" are good for business and the people who work for them, he said in an interview.
That's ""the Trump agenda"" and ""the Saccone agenda."" The Pennsylvania state representative is sidestepping nonpartisan analyses that the new law will add $1.5 trillion to the national debt over the course of a decade, despite Republicans' insistence that economic growth will replenish the treasury with higher tax receipts.
 Asked the congressional spending agreement - after it was announced but before it had passed - Saccone said, ""I haven't reviewed the details.
"" He added that he'd ""never"" cut Social Security or Medicare.
 Lamb acknowledges he may not have the easier sell, and some other Democrats agree with him.
 ""If we spend all of our cycle running against the tax bill, it's probably going to be a mistake,"" said Julie Greene, a former Democratic National Committee aide who now leads midterm campaign efforts for the AFL-CIO, the nation's largest union organization.
 During fall debate over the tax overhaul, public opinion aligned with Democrats against the bill.

 ""When I see a real-time improvement in my paycheck, I'm not thinking about what the CEO is making or his tax windfall.

 Lamb insists that's what he's doing.
Voters, he believes, can see GOP priorities in a tax law that makes corporate tax rate cuts permanent, while putting a 2026 expiration date on changes for individuals.

He died in June 2017, days after he was repatriated to the U.S. with severe brain damage.

"," WASHINGTON (AP) -- The parents of U.S. college student Otto Warmbier filed a wrongful death lawsuit against North Korea on Thursday, saying its government tortured and killed their son.
 Fred and Cindy Warmbier filed the lawsuit in the U.S.
District Court in Washington, D.C., seeking compensation for the death of the 22-year-old, whose plight had compounded tense U.S.-North Korean relations.
 Otto Warmbier, who was a student at University of Virginia, was arrested by North Korean authorities in January 2016 for stealing a propaganda poster and sentenced to 15 years in prison with hard labor.
He died in June 2017, days after he was repatriated to the U.S. with severe brain damage.
 While the lawsuit may prove largely symbolic given the difficulty of recovering any damages the court might order, it comes at a delicate time in relations between Washington and Pyongyang.
President Donald Trump is planning an unprecedented summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks to address the threat posed by its nuclear weapons, and the leaders of North and South Korea are due to meet Friday.
 ""Otto was taken hostage, kept as a prisoner for political purposes, used as a pawn and singled out for exceptionally harsh and brutal treatment by Kim Jong Un,"" Fred Warmbier said in a statement.
 ""Kim and his regime have portrayed themselves as innocent, while they intentionally destroyed our son's life.
This lawsuit is another step in holding North Korea accountable for its barbaric treatment of Otto and our family,"" he said.
 The 22-page complaint outlines in blunt terms the adverse fortunes of Warmbier after he went on a five-day tour to North Korea run by a China-based tour operator, prior to taking up a study program in Hong Kong.
He sought get a better understanding how people in the North's closed society lived, the lawsuit says.
 It says that after his arrest, Warmbier, from Cincinnati, Ohio, was pressured to make a televised confession and then convicted of subversion after a one-hour trial.
He was denied communication with his family by any means until in early June 2017 they were informed he was in a coma and had been in that condition for one year.
 The lawsuit says that when Warmbier returned, his parents ""were stunned to see his condition. Otto was blind and deaf. He had a shaved head, a feeding tube coming out of his nose, was jerking violently and howling, and was completely unresponsive to any of their efforts to comfort him."" His once straight teeth were misaligned and he had an unexplained, scarred wound on his left foot.
 North Korea claimed that Warmbier had contracted botulism but his physicians in the U.S. found no evidence of that, according to the lawsuit which says that the North's false explanations for Otto's condition demonstrate that is it ""covering up its torture and mistreatment of Otto while he was in North Korean custody."" The lawsuit contends that North Korea is liable for Warmbier's wrongful death - describing it as ""extrajudicial killing"" - and calls for a judgment for both ""economic and non-economic compensatory damages"" to his parents.
 North Korea's mission at the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond Thursday to emails and phone calls seeking comment about the lawsuit.
 There are still three Americans held in North Korea, and their cases are a continuing source of tense relations between the adversary nations.
U.S. officials have said that Mike Pompeo, the outgoing CIA director, raised the issue when he met with Kim on a rare trip to North Korea nearly four weeks ago to prepare for a Trump-Kim summit.

"," WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday shot down prospects for major parts of President Donald Trump's budget, rejecting proposed cuts to foreign aid and medical research.
 ""Every president sends up a budget, and with all due respect to the current president, I can't recall any time in which we have been sort of dictated to by either a Republican or a Democratic president,"" McConnell said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""We'll put our own imprint on it, particularly with regard to overseas.
"" Trump's budget, which would boost military spending while slashing funds for the environment, the National Institutes of Health, public broadcasting and development projects like the Appalachian Regional Commission, was widely panned by fellow Republicans last week.
 McConnell once headed the Senate panel responsible for foreign aid and stressed the importance of U.S. spending overseas.
He also was a major force behind last year's Cures Act, a law that boosts spending on medical research, and he opposes any proposed cuts.
 ""America being a force is a lot more than building up the Defense Department,"" McConnell said.
""Diplomacy is important, extremely important, and I don't think these reductions at the State Department are appropriate because many times diplomacy is a lot more effective - and certainly cheaper - than military engagement.

14,8811,"['Borg Institute', 'many women', 'technical worlds', 'cite Starbucks', 'flying high']"," SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Uber CEO Travis Kalanick will take a leave of absence for an unspecified period and let his leadership team run the troubled ride-hailing company while he's gone.
 Kalanick told employees of his decision in a memo Tuesday, just as Uber released a report from former U.S.
Attorney Eric Holder with recommendations on how to correct a workplace that lacks diversity and tolerates sexual harassment, bullying and retaliation against those who reported problems.
 Holder's firm, Covington &
Burling LLP was hired to examine Uber's workplace culture after a former employee leveled charges of sexual harassment.
 Former engineer Susan Fowler posted a blog in February that detailed harassment during the year she spent at Uber, writing that she was propositioned by her manager on her first day with an engineering team.
She reported him to human resources, but was told he would get a lecture and no further punishment because he was a ""high performer,"" she wrote.
 Holder's investigators conducted more than 200 interviews with current and former employees, including people who had knowledge of Fowler's allegations, according to the law firm's recommendations .
 The Holder report makes it clear that Uber was not doing enough to protect workers from sexual harassment and retaliation, noting that company policies need to state directly that such conduct is prohibited.
 In addition, Uber must require that managers immediately report discrimination, harassment or retaliation, and ensure that codes of conduct apply to offsite events and conferences.
 The report also says Uber should use performance reviews to hold senior managers accountable by setting metrics for improving diversity and responsiveness to employee complaints.
 Liane Hornsey, Uber's chief human resources officer, said implementing the recommendations ""will improve our culture, promote fairness and accountability, and establish processes and systems to ensure the mistakes of the past will not be repeated."" Holder recommended that Kalanick be relieved of some leadership responsibilities, shifting them to a chief operating officer and other senior managers.
The COO, yet to be hired, would be a partner with Kalanick.
 Kalanick told employees he needs time off to grieve for his mother, who died in a May boating accident.
He also says he's responsible for the company's current situation and needs to become a better leader - echoing comments the 40-year-old CEO made earlier this year after a heated argument between Kalanick and an Uber driver over pay was captured on video.
 Uber's board said it would review Kalanick's responsibilities and reassign some to others.
The board will continue its search for a chief operating officer with a background in diversity and inclusion.
 The board also recommended adding independent directors and replacing its chairman, co-founder Garrett Camp, with an independent chairman.
The board currently has eight voting members, three from within the company.
The board also called for appointment of a senior executive to oversee implementation of Holder's recommendations.
 Holder recommends that Uber make sure its workforce becomes more diverse from the top down.
Uber's diversity figures are similar to the rest of Silicon Valley, with low numbers for women and underrepresented minorities.
In the U.S., less than a third of the company's workers are female.
 In addition, the report says that diversity and inclusiveness should be a key value for Uber that's included in management training.
The word diversity appears 42 times in the 13-page recommendations document.
 While Uber released Holder's recommendations, the full report was kept private to protect the privacy of those filing complaints.
The company's board unanimously adopted all of the recommendations Sunday.
 After Fowler posted her blog, Uber Technologies Inc. made changes in human resources and opened a 24-hour hotline for employees.
Last week, the company fired 20 people including some managers at the recommendation of Perkins Coie, which separately probed specific complaints made to the company about sex harassment, bullying, and retaliation for reporting problems.
That firm checked into 215 complaints, with 57 still under investigation.
 Under Kalanick, Uber has disrupted the taxi industry in hundreds of cities and turned the San Francisco-based company into the world's most valuable startup.
Uber's valuation has climbed to nearly $70 billion.
 Besides the sexual harassment complaints, in recent months Uber has been threatened by boycotts, sued and subject to a federal investigation over its use of a fake version of its app to thwart authorities looking into whether it is breaking local laws.
 The company has faced high turnover in its top ranks.
Jeff Jones resigned as Uber's president after less than a year on the job.
He said his ""beliefs and approach to leadership"" were ""inconsistent"" with those of the company.
 Experts interviewed this week by The Associated Press said Kalanick should step aside or at minimum change his behavior for the company to make progress.

"," SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Freewheeling Uber faces major change.
Its board is cracking down, its founder and CEO is stepping away indefinitely, and the company itself is coming to grips with measures intended to reform its toxic culture and aggressive business practices.
 And it all started when Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer, posted a personal essay in February that detailed the company's toleration of sexual harassment and discrimination.
Had she not come forward in such a public manner, it's possible none of this would have happened.
 ""What she did took real courage,"" said Elizabeth Ames, a senior vice president at the Anita Borg Institute, a nonprofit founded to advance women in the technology business.
""There are many women in companies and technical worlds
(who) step up and talk about this problem.
And often they are the ones that get tagged as being the problem.
"" CH-CH-CH-CHANGES Following Fowler's post, Uber hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate her charges .
His law firm's subsequent recommendations , released Tuesday, aim to fix Uber's dysfunctional management, which allowed the male-dominated ride-hailing company to grow huge without even the most basic procedures to prevent sexual harassment, bullying and other bad behavior.
 Also on Tuesday, Uber founder and CEO Travis Kalanick accepted responsibility for the company's state and told employees that he'd be taking an indefinite leave of absence.
The company declined to say if Kalanick's decision was related to the report.
 But Kalanick wasn't the only Uber official sucked into the vortex unleashed by Fowler's essay.
On Monday, the company announced that Emil Michael, vice president for business and a close Kalanick ally, was also leaving.
Then Uber board member and hedge fund partner David Bonderman resigned Tuesday night after making what he called an inappropriate remark about women at a company meeting.
 The 13-page document from Holder's firm Covington &
Burling LLP did not outline the investigation's findings about Uber.
But its recommendations implicitly expose a startup-turned-goliath that permitted misconduct, had few policies to protect employees and ran with little board supervision.
 The recommendations, adopted unanimously by Uber's board, show clearly that the company's next incarnation - dubbed Uber 2.0 by Kalanick - will have to be radically different from version 1.0, which flouted regulations, actively misled public investigators , and disrupted the taxi business to become the world's largest ride-hailing company.
 In her essay, Fowler wrote that she was propositioned by her manager on her first day with an engineering team.
She reported him to human resources, but was told he would get a lecture and no further punishment because he was a ""high performer,"" she wrote.
 Fowler did not respond to emailed requests for comment.
But on Twitter , she called Tuesday's moves ""all optics"" and wrote that she has gotten nothing but ""aggressive hostility"" from the company.
 THE RECOMMENDATIONS After interviewing 200 witnesses, Holder had to make such basic recommendations as setting clear policies to protect workers from harassment, and that the human resources department get a better handle on keeping records and tracking employee complaints.
 The recommendations ""definitely paint a picture of a company that was out of control and pretty chaotic,"" said Ames, the Borg Institute executive.
 Holder also suggested that Uber change its written cultural values to promote positive behavior, inclusion and collaboration.
That means doing away with values that justified poor behavior, such as ""Let Builders Build,"" ''Always Be Hustlin',"" ''Meritocracy and Toe-Stepping"" and ""Principled Confrontation.
"" Holder also called for trimming Kalanick's job duties, shifting day-to-day functions to a yet-to-be-hired chief operating officer.
During Kalanick's leave, his leadership team will run the troubled company.
 Kalanick wrote that he needs time off to grieve for his mother, who died in a May boating accident.
He also said he's responsible for the company's situation and needs to become a better leader.
 THEORY AND PRACTICE Uber's board said it would review Kalanick's responsibilities and reassign some to others.
 Ames said the recommendations were strong but indicated Uber had few policies, and the ones it had were not followed.
 The board unanimously approved the recommendations on Sunday, including a suggestion that a senior executive be tasked with making sure they are implemented.
Apparently because of distrust of some leaders, Holder recommended that care be taken to make sure the executive ""is viewed positively by the employees."" The company released only Holder's recommendations, not his full report, citing the need to protect employees who complained.
 Liane Hornsey, Uber's chief human resources officer who started in January, said implementing the recommendations ""will improve our culture, promote fairness and accountability, and establish processes and systems to ensure the mistakes of the past will not be repeated."" Holder also recommended adding independent directors and replacing the board chairman, co-founder Garrett Camp, with an independent person.
The board currently has eight voting members, three from within the company.
 Uber was also advised to make sure its workforce is more diverse.
The company's diversity figures are similar to the rest of Silicon Valley, with low numbers for women and underrepresented minorities.
In the U.S., less than a third of the company's workers are female.
 In addition, the report says that diversity and inclusiveness should be a key value for Uber that's included in management training.
 After Fowler posted her essay, Uber Technologies Inc. made changes in human resources and opened a 24-hour hotline for employees.
Last week, the company fired 20 people, including some managers, at the recommendation of Perkins Coie, which separately investigated 215 employee complaints.
 FLYING HIGH? Under Kalanick, Uber has disrupted the taxi industry in hundreds of cities and turned the San Francisco-based company into the world's most valuable startup.
As of late last year, Uber's private-market valuation had climbed to nearly $70 billion.
 Besides the sexual harassment complaints, in recent months Uber has been threatened by boycotts, sued and subject to a federal investigation over its use of a fake version of its app to thwart authorities looking into whether it is breaking local laws.
 A company can be aggressive yet have strong values, said Joseph Holt, a business ethics professor at the University of Notre Dame.
He cited Starbucks as an example.
 ""Having a good reputation for ethics is a competitive advantage,"" Holt said.
 A culture change at Uber may be more difficult than Holder envisions.
 At an employee meeting Tuesday morning, Bonderman remarked that if a woman was added to the board that there likely would be more talking, according to a recording obtained by Yahoo.
 By evening, Bonderman resigned and put out a statement saying the comment was careless and inappropriate.
""I do not want my comments to create distraction as Uber works to build a culture of which we can be proud,"" the statement said.

15,16018,"['Systemic poverty', 'five decades', 'released Tuesday', 'made public', 'public tuesday', 'mortgage lending', 'mortgage leaders', 'new report']"," ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Barriers to equality are posing threats to democracy in the U.S. as the country remains segregated along racial lines and child poverty worsens, says a study examining the nation 50 years after the release of the landmark 1968 Kerner Report.
 The new report released Tuesday blames U.S. policymakers and elected officials, saying they're not doing enough to heed the warning on deepening poverty and inequality as highlighted by the Kerner Commission a half-century ago, and it lists a number of areas where the country has seen ""a lack of or reversal of progress."" ""Racial and ethnic inequality is growing worse.
We're resegregating our housing and schools again,"" former U.S.
Sen.
Fred Harris of Oklahoma, a co-editor of the new report and last surviving member of the original Kerner Commission created by President Lyndon Johnson in 1967.
""There are few more people who are poor now than was true 50 years ago. Inequality of income is worse."" The new study titled ""Healing Out Divided Society: Investing in America Fifty Years After the Kerner Report"" says the percentage of people living in deep poverty - less than half of the federal poverty level - has increased since 1975.
About 46 percent of people living in poverty in 2016 were classified as living in deep poverty - 16 percentage points higher than in 1975. And although there has been progress for Hispanic homeownership since the Kerner Commission, the homeownership gap has widened for African-Americans, the report found.
Three decades after the Fair Housing Act of 1968 passed, black homeownership rose by almost 6 percentage points.
But those gains were wiped out from 2000 to 2015 when black homeownership fell 6 percentage points, the report says.
 The report blames the black homeownership declines on the disproportionate effect the subprime crisis had on African-American families.
 In addition, gains to end school segregation were reversed because of a lack of court oversight and housing discrimination.
The court oversight allowed school districts to move away from desegregation plans and housing discrimination forced black and Latino families to move into largely minority neighborhoods.
 In 1988, for example, about 44 percent of black students went to majority-white schools nationally.
Only 20 percent of black students do so today, the report says.
 The result of these gaps means that people of color and those struggling with poverty are confined to poor areas with inadequate housing, underfunded schools and law enforcement that views those residents with suspicion, the report said.
 Those facts are bad for the whole country, and communities have a moral responsibility to address them now, said Harris, who now lives in Corrales, New Mexico.
 The new report calls on the federal government and states to push for more spending on early childhood education and a $15 minimum wage by 2024.
It also demands more regulatory oversight over mortgage leaders to prevent predatory lending, community policing that works with nonprofits in minority neighborhoods and more job training programs in an era of automation and emerging technologies.
 ""We have to have a massive outcry against the state of our public policies,"" said the Rev.
William J. Barber II, a Goldsboro, North Carolina pastor who is leading a multi-ethnic ""Poor People's Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival"" next month in multiple states. ""Systemic racism is something we don't talk about.
We need to now.
"" The late President Johnson formed the original 11-member Kerner Commission as Detroit was engulfed in a raging riot in 1967.
Five days of violence over racial tensions and police violence would leave 33 blacks and 10 whites dead, and more than 1,400 buildings burned.
More than 7,000 people were arrested.
 That summer, more than 150 cases of civil unrest erupted across the United States.
Harris and other commission members toured riot-torn cities and interviewed black and Latino residents and white police officers.
 The commission recommended that the federal government spend billions to attack structural racism in housing, education and employment.
But Johnson, angry that the commission members didn't praise his anti-poverty programs, shelved the report and refused to meet with members.
 Alan Curtis, president of the Milton S. Eisenhower Foundation and co-editor of the new report, said this study's attention to systemic racism should be less startling to the nation given the extensive research that now calls the country's discriminatory housing and criminal justice systems into question.
 Unlike the 1968 findings, the new report includes input from African-Americans, Latinos, Native Americans and women who are scholars and offer their own recommendations.
 ""The average American thinks we progressed a lot,"" said Kevin Washburn, a law professor at the University of New Mexico, a citizen of the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma and one of the people who shared his observations for the report.
""But there are still some places where Native people live primitive lives.
They don't have access to things such as good water, electricity and plumbing.
"" Like the 1968 report, the new study also calls out media organizations for their coverage of communities of color, saying they need to diversify and hire more black and Latino journalists.
 News companies could become desensitized to inequality if they lack diverse newsrooms, and they might not view the issue as urgent or newsworthy, said journalist Gary Younge, who also gave input to the report.
 ""It turns out that sometimes 'dog bites man' really is the story,"" Younge said. ""And we keep missing it.

 The 6-2 ruling said a former top lawyer at the National Labor Relations Board had served in violation of a federal law governing such appointments.
 Writing for the court, Chief Justice John Roberts said that Lafe Solomon was not allowed to serve as acting general counsel of the agency that enforces labor laws while he was at the same time nominated to fill that role permanently.
 At issue is a 1998 law aimed at preventing the president from using temporary appointments to bypass the Senate's advice-and-consent role.
The Federal Vacancies Reform Act says a person nominated for a post requiring Senate confirmation can't serve in the same position on a temporary basis.
 But the law contains an exception if the nominee served for 90 days as a ""first assistant"" to the person who previously held the office.
The Obama administration said the exception also covered Solomon because he had been a director at a different office at the NLRB.
 President Barack Obama named Solomon acting general counsel in June 2010 and he held the office until Nov. 4, 2013.
But he never won Senate confirmation because Republicans viewed him as too favorable to labor unions.
 Roberts said a close reading of the law's text shows that the exception did not cover Solomon.
He rejected the government's argument that a ruling against it would hamstring future presidents and call into question dozens of temporary appointments made over the years.
 ""This does not mean that the duties of general counsel to the NLRB needed to go unperformed,"" Roberts said.
""The president could have appointed another person to serve as the acting officer in Solomon's place.
"" Solomon's authority was challenged after an Arizona-based ambulance company was accused of unfair labor practices.
The company, SW General, Inc., said the complaint was void because Solomon's tenure was invalid.
The U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sided with the company.
 Roberts dismissed arguments that historical practice supported the government.
Since the law was enacted in 1998, three presidents have nominated 112 people for permanent posts who also were serving as acting officials.
There was never any objection from Congress.
 Roberts said those 112 nominations ""make up less than two percent of the thousands of nomination to positions in executive agencies"" that the Senate has considered during that time.
He said the Senate either may not have noticed a problem or opted not to reject a candidate just to make a point about the law.
 It's the second time in recent years that the presidential appointment process has come under scrutiny by the high court.
In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that Obama's recess appointment of three NLRB members violated the Constitution.
That ruling invalidated hundreds of NLRB rulings and forced the agency to reissue those decisions.
 Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, noting that the Senate never objected over the years while more than 100 people served in an acting capacity pending their nomination for a permanent post.
She was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
 Roberts did not explain what the impact of the court's ruling would be on specific decisions made by Solomon or any other official who might have served improperly in an acting role.
The appeals court had said it did not expect its decision ""to retroactively undermine a host of NLRB decisions."" --- This story has been corrected to show that Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the dissent.

(AP) -- A California man who used a woman he took hostage as a human shield from police gunfire after a deadly bank robbery and car chase was sentenced Tuesday to life in prison in an emotional hearing.
 Jaime Ramos, 22, pleaded guilty last year in a deal with prosecutors to avoid a possible death sentence at trial.
The 2014 robbery and chase through Stockton, 80 miles inland from San Francisco, ended in the deaths of two other suspects and Misty Holt-Singh, a 41-year-old wife, mother of two and bank customer who was taken hostage.
 Ramos didn't speak in court, but Holt-Singh's mother stood to say a few words about her daughter before breaking down in tears.
Somebody had to read her statement for her, San Joaquin County Deputy District Attorney Robert Himelblau said.
 Two other women who were taken hostage but survived did not to attend the sentencing, finding it too difficult emotionally, Himelblau said.
The plea deal avoids a stressful trial where they would have to relive the horror by testifying, he said.
 ""It makes sure that Ramos never sees the light of day again,"" the prosecutor said.
 He added that Holt-Singh's husband, Paul, made a statement, revisiting his last conversation with his wife that day and later learning she had been killed.
 In the midday heist, the three armed men stormed into a Bank of the West branch, then fled with their three hostages in an SUV owned by one of the bank employees.
 The two surviving women were injured when they were thrown from the moving vehicle or jumped out during a chase lasting nearly an hour.
In the shootout, officers fired roughly 600 bullets into the vehicle - 10 striking Holt-Singh as Ramos held her as a human shield, police have said.
 Separate from the criminal case, Holt-Singh's family and the two surviving hostages have sued the Stockton Police Department and 32 officers involved in the shooting.
City spokeswoman Connie Cochran said the three lawsuits are still pending.
 The police department commissioned a review, finding that the shots the officers fired at the end of the pursuit were excessive and unnecessary.
 Ramos pleaded guilty to murder, carjacking and attempted murder of a police officer late last year.

 James Harris Jackson, 28, turned himself in at a Times Square police station early Wednesday, a day after 66-year-old Timothy Caughman staggered into a police precinct bleeding to death.
 ""I'm the person that you're looking for,"" he told police, according to Assistant Chief William Aubrey.
He was arrested on suspicion of murder.
 Jackson told police he'd harbored feelings of hatred toward black men for at least 10 years, authorities said.
He traveled to New York on March 17 and had been staying in a Manhattan hotel.
 ""The reason he picked New York is because it's the media capital of the world, and he wanted to make a statement,"" Aubrey said.
 Jackson was wandering the streets in a long overcoat concealing a 26-inch sword when he encountered Caughman, who was collecting bottles from trash cans, police said.
Jackson stabbed him repeatedly, they said.
 Caughman, who lived nearby in a rooming house, was taken to a hospital, where he died.
 After the attack, Jackson went to the bathroom of a nearby restaurant and washed off the blood from the killing, authorities said.
 Investigators said they believed Jackson was considering other attacks but instead surrendered at a stationhouse after noticing his photo in media reports.
He had two additional knives and told police where they could find the sword used in the killing, police said.
It was retrieved from a trash can not far from the scene.
 Police reviewed video surrounding the area of the attack.
They said Jackson appeared to stay within 10 blocks of the hotel.
At one point, he appeared to walk purposefully toward a black man, but there was no attack, they said.
 Jackson was expected to appear in court later Wednesday.
It wasn't clear when he might get a lawyer who could comment on his case.
He said nothing to reporters as he was led from a precinct.
A call to his family's home rang unanswered.
 A former neighbor who tangled with Jackson over an apartment in Baltimore recalled him as ""a piece of work"" who fell months behind on rent and moved out without paying.
 ""He's just one of those people that you wish you never met,"" said Marcus Dagan.
He had been informally managing the building on behalf of its then-owner and took Jackson to court over the rent.
Dagan said Jackson ultimately moved out in 2015 without paying up.
 When Jackson moved in in 2014, he indicated he was a military veteran and was in college, studying toward becoming a lawyer, Dagan said.
Jackson left behind a collection of war movies in the apartment, the former neighbor said.
 The Navy and Marines said they didn't have a record of Jackson serving in their forces;
information wasn't immediately available from the Army, Air Force or Coast Guard.
 Bias attacks overall have more than doubled this year in New York, and there have specifically been nine bias crimes against black people reported so far this year, up from five last year.

"," NEW YORK (AP) -- A white racist accused of fatally stabbing a 66-year-old stranger on a Manhattan street because he was black says he'd intended it as ""a practice run"" in a mission to deter interracial relationships.
 James Harris Jackson, 28, spoke with a reporter for the Daily News (http://nydn.us/2nXQFgo) at New York City's Rikers Island jail complex.
 He said he envisioned a white woman thinking: ""Well, if that guy feels so strongly about it, maybe I shouldn't do it.
"" The victim, Timothy Caughman, who was remembered as a gentleman and a good neighbor, was alone and collecting bottles for recycling last week when he was attacked from behind with a sword.
He staggered, bleeding, into a police station and later died at a hospital.
 Jackson was in court Monday, as prosecutors charged him with murder as an act of terrorism in addition to the murder as a hate crime charge he'd already been facing.
Jackson did not speak, and his attorney had no comment.
 Childhood friends of Caughman, who grew up in Queens, attended the hearing and said he was a kind man who didn't deserve the brutality.
 ""Tim Caughman did not deserve to die like that,"" said Portia Clark.
""Nobody does.
I mean, come on, we're black, white, yellow, brown - that's ridiculous.
We're trying to get along.
"" Carl Nimmons wept outside court after seeing Jackson.
""It really hurt me to see that man, because I can't do nothing about it.
I don't have the power to do anything about it,"" he said.
 In the interview, Jackson said in retrospect, he would rather have killed ""a young thug"" or ""a successful older black man with blondes ... people you see in Midtown. These younger guys that put white girls on the wrong path."" He complained that on television, ""it's like every other commercial in the past few years has a mixed-race couple in it.
"" ""The white race is being eroded.
...
No one cares about you.
The Chinese don't care about you, the blacks don't care about you,"" he said.
 Jackson, 28, who was raised in what was described as a churchgoing, liberal family in a Baltimore suburb, said his ideal society is ""1950s America."" Jackson was in the Army from 2009 to 2012 and worked as an intelligence analyst, the Army said.
Deployed in Afghanistan in 2010-11, he earned several medals and attained the rank of specialist.
 The military training, Jackson said, helped him plan the bloodshed.
 ""I had been thinking about it for a long time, for the past couple of years,"" he said.
""I figured I would end up getting shot by police, kill myself, or end up in jail."" He is charged with murder as a hate crime.
 His attorney, Sam Talkin, has said if the allegations are anywhere close to being true, ""then we're going to address the obvious psychological issues that are present in this case.

21,2909,"['nancy pelosi', 'white house', 'american', 'embraced inner', 'inner statesman', 'His administration reveled', 'Navy SEAL', 'rave reviews', 'wednesday morning']"," WASHINGTON (AP) -- Donald Trump finally gave Republicans what they've spent months begging him to deliver: a pivot to presidential.
 The question now is how long it lasts.
Days, weeks, months - or simply until the next tweet? Just a little more than a month into his presidency, Trump clearly wanted to use his first speech to Congress to reset a chaotic start to his administration.
 Gone was the dark tone that marked his inaugural address, replaced by optimism and pleas for bipartisan support.
Standing before lawmakers, Supreme Court justices and military leaders on Tuesday night, the famously unrestrained politician was softer, sober and verged on diplomatic.
 ""I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart,"" he said, in the opening of his hourlong speech.
 But while his prime-time address wrapped his nationalistic politics in more presidential prose, it's unlikely to overcome the deep divides created by his first few weeks in office.
 For a candidate who sold himself as a master dealmaker, Trump has shown little inclination to get deeply involved with the kind of nitty gritty negotiating that defines the legislative process.
 That's left the Capitol reeling.
 Republicans have united control for the first time in decades but no agreement over the specifics of long-promised plans to repeal Obamacare and revamp the tax code.
The civil service is in not-so-quiet revolt.
And weeks of protests and raucous town halls are putting fresh political pressure on lawmakers from both parties to resist his agenda.
 The stakes are high not only in terms of policy but politics: If the GOP is unable to make good on years of election promises, they could enter the midterm elections in a far weaker position than expected.
 Trump, meanwhile, faces record low approval ratings - just 44 percent of Americans approve of his job performance, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey.
 He's nearing the end of big achievements he can enact by executive order, forcing him to rely on Congress to turn the bold promises of his campaign into actual achievements Trump needed to use his prime-time address to show he could steady his flailing White House and focus on the difficult work required to pass his legislative agenda.
 Still, he arrived at the Capitol in a blaze of accusations, enraging his opponents before he even entered the building.
 In the 24 hours before his address, he blamed former President Barack Obama for town hall protests and security leaks, called House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ""incompetent"" and said his generals, not the commander in chief, were responsible for a military raid in Yemen that killed a Navy SEAL.
 In his speech, he called on Washington to ""work past the differences of party."" The candidate who won the White House by taking a hard-line stance on immigration, seemed to express openness to a bipartisan immigration bill.
 The president whose administration spent much of its first weeks in office battling with the media, intelligence community, federal judiciary and even Hollywood celebrities asked for an end to ""trivial fights."" And after questioning the authenticity of a wave of bomb threats against Jewish community centers, he condemned the flood of anti-Semitic attacks and other racially motivated crimes.
 For House GOP leaders, Trump came tantalizingly close to backing their plan to overhaul the tax code by imposing a new tax on imports while exempting exports.
He appeared to lend support to the House Republican leaders' plan for Obamacare, by embracing ""tax credits"" and health savings accounts.
 His comments won praise from Republican leaders.
House Speaker Paul Ryan called the speech a ""home run."" Ryan's Democratic counterpart, Nancy Pelosi, said the speech was ""utterly disconnected from the cruel reality of his conduct."" But on other issues, Trump offered barely a blueprint for his initiatives.
 He repeated his campaign pledge to make a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure, adding no new details to a proposal that's sure to face fierce resistance from budget hawks.
Big promises to make childcare more affordable, ensure paid family leave, invest in women's health and a major education bill were mentioned merely in passing.
 There was no discussion of how his administration would fund any of the new - and expensive - programs, putting him in direct conflict with a Republican Party that's long focused on cutting the deficit.
 On foreign policy, he promised a massive expansion in military spending, even as he made no mention of Iraq or Afghanistan, where American troops are still stationed.
And he avoided commenting on U.S.-Russia relations, an area where he's sparked major controversy even within his own party, making only a nebulous reference to an America ""willing to find new friends."" ""We will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began,"" Trump said at the conclusion of his speech.
""I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country."" As they burst into cheers, Republicans quietly wondered which Trump would show up in the morning.

"," WASHINGTON (AP) -- Donald Trump finally gave Republicans what they've spent months begging him to deliver: a pivot to presidential behavior.
 The question now is how long it lasts.
Days, weeks, months - or simply until the next tweet? Just a little more than a month into his presidency, the new president clearly wanted to use his first speech to Congress to reset the chaotic start of his administration.
 Gone was the dark tone that marked his inaugural address, replaced by optimism and pleas for bipartisan support.
Standing before lawmakers, Supreme Court justices and military leaders, the famously unrestrained Trump was softer, sober and practically subdued.
 ""I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart,"" he said, in the opening of his hour-long speech.
 His administration reveled in the rave reviews on Wednesday morning.
 ""What the American people saw is the president I serve with every day - broad shoulders, a big heart,"" Vice President Mike Pence said, in an interview with NBC's ""Today Show."" The White House delayed the signing of his revamped travel ban, saying they were still putting the final touches on the new executive order but also, presumably, to avoid competing with positive press from the speech.
Republican leaders were scheduled to join the president for lunch at the White House to discuss how they move forward with key agenda items.
 But though the prime-time address to Congress and the nation wrapped Trump's signature nationalistic politics in presidential prose, it is unlikely to overcome the deep divisions created by his first few weeks in office.
 For a candidate who sold himself as a master dealmaker, Trump has shown little inclination to get deeply involved with the kind of nitty gritty negotiating that defines the legislative process.
 That's left the Capitol reeling.
 Republicans have united control for the first time in decades but no agreement over the specifics of long-promised plans to repeal ""Obamacare"" and revamp the tax code.
The federal civil service is in not-so-subtle revolt.
And weeks of protests and raucous town halls are putting fresh political pressure on lawmakers from both parties to resist his agenda.
 Trump, meanwhile, faces record low approval ratings - just 44 percent of Americans approve of his job performance, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey.
 He needed to use his prime-time address to show he could steady his flailing White House and focus on the difficult work required to pass his legislative agenda.
Trump is nearing the end of big achievements he can enact by executive order, forcing him to rely on Congress to turn the bold promises of his campaign into actual achievements.
 So, he embraced his inner statesman.
 The candidate who won the White House by taking a hard-line stance on immigration seemed to express openness to a bipartisan immigration bill.
 The president whose administration spent much of its first weeks in office battling with the media, intelligence community, federal judiciary and even Hollywood celebrities asked for an end to ""trivial fights."" In his speech, he called on Washington to ""work past the differences of party."" Less than 24 hours earlier, he'd blamed former President Barack Obama for town hall protests and security leaks and called House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ""incompetent"" in a Fox News interview.
 He said his generals, not the commander in chief, were responsible for a military raid in Yemen that killed a Navy SEAL.
Hours later, Trump's tribute to the slain solider, as his crying widow stood in the audience, became a signature moment of his address.
 And after questioning the authenticity of a wave of bomb threats against Jewish community centers in a private Tuesday meeting with attorney generals, he opened his remarks by condemning the flood of anti-Semitic attacks and other racially motivated crimes.
 For House GOP leaders, Trump came tantalizingly close to backing their plan to overhaul the tax code by imposing a new tax on imports while exempting exports.
He appeared to lend support to the House Republican leaders' plan for Obamacare, embracing the ""tax credits"" and health savings accounts that are a centerpiece of the GOP policy.
 But on other issues, Trump offered barely a blueprint for his initiatives.
 He repeated his campaign pledge to make a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure, adding no new details to a proposal that's sure to face fierce resistance from budget hawks.
Big promises to make childcare more affordable, ensure paid family leave, invest in women's health and a major education bill were mentioned merely in passing.

22,16066,"['background checks', 'sporting goods']"," NEW YORK (AP) -- Dick's Sporting Goods will immediately end sales of assault-style rifles and high capacity magazines at all of its stores and ban the sale of all guns to anyone under 21 years old.
 The announcement Wednesday comes two weeks after the school massacre in Parkland, Florida.
 ""When we saw what the kids were going through and the grief of the parents and the kids who were killed in Parkland, we felt we needed to do something,"" Chairman and CEO Edward Stack said on """"Good Morning America."" Dick's, a major gun retailer, had cut off sales of assault-style weapons at Dick's stores following the Sandy Hook school shooting.
But Dick's owns dozens of its Field &
Stream stores, where there has been no such ban in place.
 In a letter released Wednesday, Stack wrote, ""''We support and respect the Second Amendment, and we recognize and appreciate that the vast majority of gun owners in this country are responsible, law-abiding citizens.
But we have to help solve the problem that's in front of us.
Gun violence is an epidemic that's taking the lives of too many people, including the brightest hope for the future of America -- our kids.
"" Nickolas Cruz, the gunman who killed 17 people in Florida, mostly students, had purchased a shotgun at a Dick's store in November 2017, Stack said.
 ""It was not the gun, nor type of gun, he used in the shooting,"" Stack wrote.
""But it could have been. Clearly this indicates on so many levels that the systems in place are not effective to protect our kids and our citizens."" The gun issue has embroiled a number of companies since the Parkland shooting, from Delta Airlines to FedEx.
 Dick's Sporting Goods Inc. is based in Pittsburgh in a state where the first day of deer hunting season is an unofficial holiday for some families.
 Stack said on ""Good Morning America"" that Dick's is prepared for any potential backlash, but will never allow the sale of such guns in its stores again.
 Stack on Wednesday called on elected officials to ban assault-style firearms, bump stocks and high capacity magazines and raise the minimum age to buy firearms to
21. He said universal background checks should be required, and there should be a complete universal database of those banned from buying firearms.
He also called for the closure of the private sale and gun show loophole that waives the necessity of background checks.
 Walmart Inc., also a big gun seller, stopped selling AR-15 rifles and other semi-automatic weapons in 2015.
"," NEW YORK (AP) -- Dick's Sporting Goods and Walmart took steps Wednesday to restrict gun sales, adding two retail heavyweights to the growing rift between corporate America and the gun lobby.
 Dick's said it will immediately stop selling assault-style rifles and ban the sale of all guns to anyone under
21. Its CEO took on the National Rifle Association by demanding tougher gun laws after the massacre in Florida.
 Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, followed late Wednesday saying it will no longer sell firearms and ammunition to people younger than
21. It had stopped selling AR-15s and other semi-automatic weapons in 2015, citing weak sales.
 The announcements from the major national retailers came as students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, returned to class for the first time since a teenager killed 17 students and educators with an AR-15 rifle two weeks ago.
 ""When we saw what the kids were going through and the grief of the parents and the kids who were killed in Parkland, we felt we needed to do something,"" Dick's Chairman and CEO Ed Stack said on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" Several major corporations, including MetLife, Hertz and Delta Air Lines, have cut ties with the NRA since the Florida tragedy.
None of them were retailers who sold guns.
 Sporting goods chain Bass Pro Shops, which owns Cabela's, didn't respond to requests for comment.
Nor did the Outdoor Retail Association or Gander Outdoors.
 The announcements from Dick's and Walmart drew hundreds of thousands of responses for and against the moves on the companies' social media accounts.
 Dick Sporting Goods had cut off sales of assault-style weapons after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.
But sales had resumed at its smaller chain of Field &
Stream stores, which consisted of 35 outlets in 16 states as of October.
 On Wednesday, Stack said that would end, and he called on lawmakers to act now.
 He urged them to ban assault-style firearms, bump stocks and high-capacity magazines and raise the minimum age to buy firearms to
21. He said universal background checks should be required, and there should be a complete database of those banned from buying firearms.
He also called for the closing of the private sale and gun show loophole that enables purchasers to escape background checks.
 ""We support and respect the Second Amendment, and we recognize and appreciate that the vast majority of gun owners in this country are responsible, law-abiding citizens,"" Stack said in a letter. ""But we have to help solve the problem that's in front of us.
Gun violence is an epidemic that's taking the lives of too many people, including the brightest hope for the future of America - our kids.
"" Walmart said it was also removing items from its website that resemble assault-style rifles, including airsoft guns and toys.
""Our heritage as a company has always been in serving sportsmen and hunters, and we will continue to do so in a responsible way,"" Walmart said.
 One industry analyst said that other retailers that devote a small percentage of their business to hunting will probably follow suit.
While guns can be bought from sporting goods stores or department stores, they can also be purchased online, at gun shows and from small local gun stores.
 The NRA has pushed back aggressively against calls for raising age limits for guns or restricting the sale of assault-style weapons.
Calls to the NRA were not immediately returned.
 Stack also revealed that Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old arrested in the Florida attack, had bought a shotgun at a Dick's store within the past four months.
 ""It was not the gun, nor type of gun, he used in the shooting,"" the CEO wrote.
""But it could have been. Clearly this indicates on so many levels that the systems in place are not effective to protect our kids and our citizens."" The vast majority of Dick's business is selling sporting goods like basketballs and sneakers.
Joseph Feldman, a senior managing director at the Telsey Advisory Group, estimated that guns and ammunition account for 8 percent of the company's sales.
 Dick's, which had net sales of $7.92 billion in the fiscal year that ended in January 2017, has a much bigger stake in youth sports.
 ""The longer-term positive perception that they create a more welcoming environment will offset any lost sales in the year,"" Feldman said.
 Dick's is based just outside of Pittsburgh in a state where the first day of deer hunting season is an unofficial holiday for many families.
Stack said Dick's is prepared for any backlash but will never allow the sale of such guns in its stores again.
 ""This is the moment when business leaders across the country get to decide if they want to stand on the right side of history,"" said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Acton for Gun Sense in America.
""Mothers make the majority of spending decisions for their families, and we want to shop with businesses that care about the safety of our families - making this a smart business move, too.
"" Pam Platt of Louisville, Kentucky, said she was thrilled to hear about Dick's move and called the store's customer service line to offer her praise.
She said she told the representative who answered that she wanted her to ""hear something good from somebody."" ""She perked up,"" Platt added.
 Platt said she now plans to start buying more at her local Dick's store, including a pair of sneakers this week.
 ""When I go to the store, I will let them know why I am here,"" she said.
""I care about this issue."" But many others were unhappy with the company's move, some posting on the Dick's page that they would stop shopping at its stores.
 ""I was sad to hear they would pull them off and bow to these people that have no understanding of what a gun is,"" said Gerald Jaeger, outside a Dick's in Brookfield, Wisconsin.
 Dick's stock ended Wednesday up 22 cents at $32.02. --- AP Retail Writers Anne D'Innocenzio and Joseph Pisani contributed to this report.

 The 97-year-old Stevens says in an essay on The New York Times website that repeal would weaken the National Rifle Association's ability to ""block constructive gun control legislation."" Stevens was on the losing end of a 2008 ruling in which the high court held that the Second Amendment gives individuals the right to own a gun for self-defense.

"" Stevens retired from the court in 2010, after more than 35 years.
 In his essay published Tuesday, Stevens talks about the ""March for Our Lives"" events on Saturday which drew crowds in cities across the country.
Stevens said the demonstrations ""reveal the broad public support for legislation to minimize the risk of mass killings of schoolchildren and others in our society."" He said the support ""is a clear sign to lawmakers to enact legislation prohibiting civilian ownership of semiautomatic weapons, increasing the minimum age to buy a gun from 18 to 21 years old, and establishing more comprehensive background checks on all purchasers of firearms."" But Stevens called on demonstrators to ""seek more effective and more lasting reform."" ""They should demand a repeal of the Second Amendment,"" he wrote.
 Repealing the amendment would be extremely difficult.
An amendment to the Constitution can only be proposed either by Congress with a two thirds vote in both houses or by a constitutional convention called for by two thirds of the state legislatures.
The amendment then has to be approved by three quarters of the states.
 Asked at a White House briefing whether President Donald Trump had any reaction to Stevens' comments, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president and administration ""still fully support the Second Amendment."" ""We think that the focus has to remain on removing weapons from dangerous individuals, not on blocking all Americans from their constitutional rights,"" she said.
 The National Rifle Association also issued a statement in response to Stevens' essay.
 ""The men and women of the National Rifle Association, along with the majority of the American people and the Supreme Court, believe in the Second Amendment right to self-protection and we will unapologetically continue to fight to protect this fundamental freedom,"" the statement said.

 The court handed both Abdeslam and Sofiane Ayari the maximum 20 year sentence.
 It said the ""terror character"" was clearly established in the March 2016 shooting, four months after the Paris attacks that killed 130. Court president Luc Hennart said the two chose not to attend the reading of the verdict and sentencing.

"," BRUSSELS (AP) -- A Belgian court on Monday found 2015 Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam and an accomplice guilty of attempted murder over shots fired at police as they sought to avoid arrest in Brussels.
 The court handed both Abdeslam, Europe's most wanted fugitive at the time, and Sofiane Ayari the maximum 20-year sentence.
 It said the ""terror character"" was clearly established in the March 2016 shooting, four months after the Paris attacks that killed 130.

Three officers were wounded.
 His lawyer Sven Mary said it remains to be seen whether Abdeslam will seek to appeal his sentence.
He has 30 days to decide.
Mary insisted it is unclear whether Abdeslam himself had fired shots at officers trying to break into the hideout.
 ""If there is doubt, he should have been let go, it's that simple,"" Mary said.
 Abdeslam attended the opening day of the trial in February but has refused to cooperate since.

25,16127,['officials spoke']," WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Donald Trump wants to bring feuding Persian Gulf leaders to Camp David for a show of solidarity with the United States.
But there are strings attached: No breakthrough in the Qatar crisis, no Camp David.
 A potential summit of the six-country Gulf Cooperation Council in May at the prestigious presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains will be scuttled unless Qatar and neighbors Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain are on track to resolve the nearly year-long spat.
A pair of Trump administration emissaries will deliver the message next week as they crisscross the Gulf in a renewed bid to try to end the crisis.
 It's not clear that the Gulf countries even want to attend such a summit, which would require leaders who have spent the last eight months bashing Qatar to put all of that aside and pose for friendly group photo-ops.
But if there's one trait that unifies Qatar and its neighbors, it's an unwavering desire to show they're simpatico with Trump.
 Yet even as the White House holds out hope for a summit, it's telling Gulf nations there's no sense in proceeding as long as the quarreling countries are still not on speaking terms, according to several U.S. officials and others briefed on the situation.
There's also concern that holding the summit while the crisis is still raging could lead to drama that would reflect poorly on Trump the host, the individuals said.
 Short of one side or the other fully capitulating, it's unclear what steps the countries could take that would demonstrate enough progress to merit moving ahead with the summit.
But one proposal being floated by the U.S. is for Qatar's neighbors to end the air blockade that has prevented Qatari flights from landing in the other nations or using their airspace, officials said.
 There was no comment from the White House or the embassies of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
A Saudi official said the notion that the U.S. was pressing Saudi Arabia to end the crisis to make way for a summit was ""false,"" adding that the leaders of both countries ""are keen on continuing cooperation between both our countries and between the G.C.C. and the U.S.A."" The official wasn't authorized to comment by name and demanded anonymity.
 Qatar has been under siege since early June, when its neighbors severed ties over claims the small, gas-rich monarchy was funding terrorism, disrupting Gulf unity and fomenting opposition across the region.
They cut Qatar's air, sea and land routes, creating a de facto blockade.
The countries vowed to isolate Qatar economically until it heeds their demands, but Qatar has insisted it can survive indefinitely on its own.
Eight months later, the crisis is at a standstill, with both sides dug in firmer than ever.
 Early on, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson tried to broker a resolution, even shuttling between the countries for indirect talks.
When that failed, the United States stepped back, and has largely left it to Kuwait - another GCC country - to mediate.
 Since then, the U.S. has offered cautious praise for steps Qatar has taken to address concerns about lax financial regulations that allowed funds to flow to terror groups.
But those steps have failed to satisfy Saudi Arabia and the other neighbors, whose list of demands also includes shutting down Qatar-based news network Al-Jazeera and cutting ties with Islamist groups including the Muslim Brotherhood.
Qatar claims those demands constitute a major infringement on its sovereignty.
 ""Qatar's steps in addressing Trump's concerns regarding terror financing gave room for Tillerson to make the case to Trump that at least for Washington, the U.S. concerns were largely addressed, and the outstanding differences between Qatar and its neighbors had become a distraction,"" said Andrew Bowen, who studies the Persian Gulf at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
 In a fresh push to resolve the dispute, the Trump administration is sending Tim Lenderking, the top State Department official for the Persian Gulf, and retired Marine Corps.
Gen.
Anthony Zinni to the region to meet with officials from the countries involved in the dispute.
 The renewed U.S. involvement comes as Trump prepares for a string of visits by leaders from the feuding nations.
Saudi Arabia's powerful crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, will visit Washington in mid-March, and the UAE's Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed, is expected in the coming weeks as well.
 Trump spoke by phone this week with both leaders, as well as with Qatar's ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.
The White House issued nearly identical descriptions of all three calls, saying Trump had discussed ""a range of security and economic issues"" without mentioning whether the regional crisis even came up.

26,17858,"['maintained his innocence', 'power', 'additional accusers', 'civil suit', 'five women', 'referred to prison', '$3.4 million']"," PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The jury that convicted Bill Cosby at his sexual assault retrial said that its decision was only influenced by what happened in court, and the youngest member of the panel said that the comedian's own words sealed his fate.
 Harrison Snyder said in an interview aired Monday on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that Cosby's deposition - in which he admitted giving women drugs to have sex with them - was the evidence that made him believe he was guilty.
 ""I think it was his deposition, really.
Mr. Cosby admitted to giving these quaaludes to women, young women, in order to have sex with them,"" Snyder said of a deposition that was part of a civil case brought by accuser Andrea Constand.
 The 22-year-old said it ""wasn't an open and shut case,"" but that he had no doubt the jury made the right decision in convicting Cosby Thursday on three counts of aggravated indecent assault.
 The investigation into Cosby was reopened in July 2015 after a federal judge, acting on a request from The Associated Press, unsealed portions of Cosby's deposition testimony from a civil lawsuit he settled with Constand in 2006 for $3.4 million.
In the testimony, which was read to jurors at both trials, he described giving quaaludes to women before sex in the 1970s and his encounters with Constand, a Temple University women's basketball administrator.
 Snyder said he didn't know much about the 80-year-old comedian before the trial and knew nothing of the allegations.
 ""I knew he was an actor, I knew he did the 'Cosby Show.' I never watched the 'Cosby Show,' I'm a little too young for that,"" Snyder said Cosby, 80, is now a prisoner in his own suburban Philadelphia home and faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life behind bars as he awaits sentencing within the next three months on three counts of aggravated indecent assault.
He has maintained his innocence.
His publicist has declared his conviction a ""public lynching,"" and his lawyers have vowed to appeal.
 NBC's ""Today"" show said Monday the Cosby jury issued a statement saying its decision was not influenced in any way by factors other than what was seen and heard in the courtroom.
They said race and the #MeToo movement were never discussed.
 ""After thoughtful and meticulous consideration of the information and evidence provided to us, we came to our unanimous verdict,"" the jury said in the statement.
""Not once were race or the #metoo movement ever discussed, nor did either factor into our decision, as implied in various media outlets.
"" Prosecutor Kristen Feden told The Associated Press in an interview Saturday that in the tense moments before the jury convicted Cosby, she started to worry about the global implications if the #MeToo era's first big trial went the other way.
 ""I felt like this verdict could dictate something more,"" Feden said.
""If they found him not guilty, I felt like they were feeding into every character assassination on sex crime victims."" Cosby's lawyers have vowed to appeal, but prosecutors said they are confident Cosby's conviction will stand.
 Two days after Cosby's conviction, law books and papers were still strewn on a long table in the war room where prosecutors plotted their strategy: leading off with an expert to educate the jury in victim behavior, successfully fighting to call five additional accusers and fending off the defense's allegations that Constand was a scammer framing Cosby for a big payday.
 The additional accusers allowed prosecutors to uncloak the man once revered as America's Dad as a manipulative predator who used his built-in trust to trick women into taking powerful intoxicants so he could violate them.
One woman pointedly called Cosby a ""serial rapist,"" and another asked him through her tears, ""You remember, don't you, Mr. Cosby?"" Feden, who worked out a deal to stay as a special prosecutor after leaving for private practice, said she felt ""that needed to be exposed."" ""That was the most sickening part of this all,"" she said.
""When people in positions of power use that power to victimize people, I find that to be beyond disgusting."" The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission, as Constand has done.

"," PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Speaking out for the first time, the jury that convicted Bill Cosby at his sexual assault retrial said Monday it found the comedian's chief accuser to be ""credible and compelling,"" adding its verdict had nothing to do with the #MeToo movement or any another factor outside the courtroom.
 The jury wrote in a statement that it had ""absolutely no reservations"" about convicting Cosby of three counts of aggravated indecent assault.
The youngest member of the panel, meanwhile, said in a separate TV interview that the comedian's own words about giving women quaaludes before sex in the 1970s sealed his fate.
 Andrea Constand, now 45, testified that Cosby gave her three blue pills that knocked her out and then molested her at his home in 2004.
The defense said it was consensual.
 Cosby settled Constand's civil suit for nearly $3.4 million in 2006, and his lawyers claimed at trial that she had framed him for the money.
 But the jury rejected the defense argument.
 ""Simply put, we were asked to assess the credibility of Ms. Constand's account of what happened to her, and each one of us found her account credible and compelling,"" said the jury statement, which was dated Sunday and distributed Monday.
 Juror Harrison Snyder, 22, told ABC that Cosby's 2005 deposition was the evidence that made him believe he was guilty.
 ""I think it was his deposition, really.
Mr. Cosby admitted to giving these quaaludes to women, young women, in order to have sex with them,"" Snyder said on ""Good Morning America.
"" Snyder said it ""wasn't an open and shut case,"" but added he had no doubt the jury reached the correct verdict Thursday.
 The investigation into Cosby was reopened in July 2015 after a federal judge, acting on a request from The Associated Press, unsealed portions of Cosby's deposition testimony from the civil suit he settled with Constand.
In the testimony, which was read to jurors at both trials, he described giving quaaludes to women before sex in the 1970s.
Cosby also described his sexual encounters with Constand, a Temple University women's basketball administrator.
 Five other women testified at the retrial that Cosby had drugged and molested them as well, but Snyder said they weren't a factor in his decision.
 ""I don't think it really necessarily mattered that these other five women were here because he said it himself that he used drugs for other women,"" he said.
 In its statement, the Cosby jury said its decision was not influenced in any way by factors other than what was seen and heard in the courtroom.
 ""After thoughtful and meticulous consideration of the information and evidence provided to us, we came to our unanimous verdict,"" the jury said.
""Not once were race or the #MeToo movement ever discussed, nor did either factor into our decision, as implied in various media outlets.
"" Cosby, 80, is now a prisoner in his own suburban Philadelphia home and faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life behind bars as he awaits sentencing, likely within the next three months.
His publicist has declared his conviction a ""public lynching,"" and his lawyers have vowed to appeal.
 ""This is what they wanted,"" Cosby told the New York Post's Page Six after his conviction.
He referred to prison as ""that place."" The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission, as Constand has done.

27,16942,"['child protective', 'protective services', 'Dana DeKalb', 'missing children', 'DeKalb said']"," SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Searchers in boats and aircraft scoured the Northern California coast Wednesday for three missing children whose parents and three siblings died when their SUV plunged off a scenic highway onto rocks in the ocean below.
 The California Highway Patrol has not determined why the vehicle went off the overlook.
Officials in Oregon and Washington, where the family has lived, have not been able to find the missing children of Jennifer and Sarah Hart at their home in a small city outside Portland, Oregon, or with family members and friends.
 One of the missing children was an African-American boy who gained widespread attention when he was photographed hugging a white officer during a 2014 protest over a fatal police shooting of a black man.
 The Harts lived most recently in Woodland, Washington, and recently had a visit from Child Protective Services, Clark County sheriff's Sgt.
Brent Waddell told The Associated Press.
 He said the sheriff's office later entered the house and found no obvious signs of trouble or violence.
It appeared the family planned a short trip because they left behind a pet, chickens and most of their belongings.
 Sarah Hart had pleaded guilty to a domestic assault charge in Minnesota in 2011.
Her plea also led to the dismissal of a charge of malicious punishment of a child, online court records say.
 The women, both 39, and their children Markis Hart, 19;
Jeremiah Hart, 14;
and Abigail Hart, 14, were killed Monday when their SUV plunged 100 feet (31 meters) from an ocean overlook on the Pacific Coast Highway about 150 miles (241 kilometers) north of San Francisco.
 Searchers were looking for Hannah Hart, 16;
Devonte Hart, 15;
and Sierra Hart, 12. Bill Groener, 67, was a next-door neighbor of the family when they lived in West Linn, Oregon, and described the siblings as foster children.
 ""They were friendly enough.
The kids were all home-schooled.
They stayed indoors most of the time, even in really nice weather,"" Groener told AP.
 He said the family didn't eat sugar, raised their own vegetables, had animals and went on camping trips.
 ""There was enough positive there to kind of counteract the feeling that something maybe wasn't quite right,"" Groener said.
 He said they were neighbors for about two years and that ""privacy was a big thing for them."" The family got attention after Devonte Hart was photographed during a 2014 protest in Portland, Oregon, over a grand jury's decision not to indict a police officer in the shooting of a black man in Ferguson, Missouri.
 The boy, holding a ""Free Hugs"" sign, stood crying out of sadness over the events.
 A Portland officer saw his sign and asked if he could have a hug, and an emotional Hart embraced him in a picture that was widely shared.
 Zippy Lomax, a Portland photographer who knew the family, told the Oregonian/Oregonlive.com that the reaction overwhelmed the Harts, with negative attention focused on the multiracial family with lesbian parents.
 ""They kind of closed off for a while, honestly,"" Lomax told the newspaper.
 She said the Harts frequently traveled to festivals and shows and that ""Jen and Sarah were the kind of parents this world desperately needs."" ""I'm sure they were going somewhere special and fun,"" Lomax told the newspaper.

"," WOODLAND, Wash.
(AP) -- The two women and their six adopted children traveled to festivals and events, offering free hugs and promoting unity, friends said.
They raised animals and grew vegetables and last year moved onto a piece of land in rural southwest Washington, a dream of theirs.
 The Hart Tribe, as they were known, also took spontaneous road trips to hike or camp, and friends believe they may have been on one of those adventures when their SUV plunged off a scenic California highway.
 ""We know that an entire family vanished and perished during this tragedy,"" said Mendocino County Sheriff Tom Allman on Wednesday as he appealed for help retracing where the family had been before the vehicle was found Monday.
 Friends described married couple Jennifer and Sarah Hart as loving, inspiring parents who promoted social justice and exposed their ""remarkable children"" to art, music and nature.
But neighbors said they saw signs that caused them to worry about how the homeschooled children were being cared for.
 The California Highway Patrol has not determined why the vehicle went off an ocean overlook on a rugged part of coastline.
A specialized team of accident investigators was trying to figure that out, Allman said.
 ""We have no evidence and no reason to believe that this was an intentional act,"" he said, adding that the scene was confusing because ""there were no skid marks, there were no brake marks"" at the roadside turnout where the vehicle went over.
 Authorities believe six children were in the vehicle with their parents, though three siblings haven't been found.
 The 100-foot (31-meter) drop killed both women, both 39, and their children Markis Hart, 19;
Jeremiah Hart, 14;
and Abigail Hart,
14. Hannah Hart, 16;
Devonte Hart, 15;
and Sierra Hart, 12, have not been found.
 ""This is a tragic accident of a magnitude that cannot be measured,"" said Zippy Lomax, a photographer who knew the Harts.
 ""They were really radiant, warm, adventurous inspiring people. They were always on some grand adventure, and the kids were living this life that was kind of like this dream,"" Lomax told The Associated Press.
""The family was this very self-supporting unit that was impossible to miss.
When they showed up to an event, they made an impression.
They shattered a lot of norms and they did not shy away from controversy or adversity.
"" The Harts, who went to events such as rallies for presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, often showed up in matching T-shirts.
 The family gained attention after Devonte Hart was photographed during a 2014 protest in Portland, Oregon, over a grand jury's decision not to indict a police officer in the shooting of a black man in Ferguson, Missouri.
The boy, holding a ""Free Hugs"" sign, stood crying.
A Portland officer saw his sign and asked if he could have a hug, and an emotional Hart embraced him in a picture that was widely shared.
 The Harts moved to Woodland, Washington, a small city outside Portland, Oregon, in the spring of last year, partly overwhelmed by the media coverage.
The multi-racial family also received death threats, Ribner said.
 The family had a recent visit from state child protective services, Clark County sheriff's Sgt.
Brent Waddell told AP.
 Next-door neighbors Bruce and Dana DeKalb said they called child services Friday because they were concerned about Devonte Hart, who they said had been coming over to their house in the past week asking for food.
 Dana DeKalb said the boy told her his parents ""weren't feeding them"" and were ""punishing them by withholding food.
"" He came over almost every day for a week, and asked her to leave food in a box by the fence for him, she said.
 Washington state child protective services opened an investigation Friday and tried to make contact with the family three times since Friday, but weren't able to reach them, said Norah West, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Social and Health Services.
The agency had no prior history with the family, she said.
 The DeKalbs also recounted that three months after the family moved into the home on 2 acres with a fenced pasture in May 2017, one of the girls rang their doorbell at 1:30 a.m. She ""was at our door in a blanket saying we needed to protect her,"" Bruce DeKalb said.
""She said that they were abusing her."" In 2011, Sarah Hart pleaded guilty to a domestic assault charge in Minnesota.
Her plea led to the dismissal of a charge of malicious punishment of a child, online court records say.
 Max Ribner, who has known the family since 2012, said allegations from neighbors don't square with what he knows about the Harts.
 ""They are beautiful examples of opening arms to strangers, helping youth, supporting racial equality,"" Ribner, who lives in Portland, told the AP.
""They brought so much joy to the world. They represented a legacy of love."" Bill Groener, 67, was a next-door neighbor of the Harts when they lived in West Linn, Oregon, and said the kids stayed indoors most of the time.

 Mhlengi Gwala, 27, was undergoing surgery after the attack which occurred before dawn on Tuesday in the coastal city of Durban, said Dennis Jackson, director of the elite athlete program for KwaZulu-Natal province.
 Several attackers pulled Gwala off his bicycle as he cycled up a steep hill and sawed into his right calf, damaging muscle, nerves and bone, according to Jackson, who spoke by phone to the triathlete about the ordeal.
They missed a main artery and surgeons are confident they can save the leg, Jackson said.
 The attackers also started sawing into Gwala's left leg before fleeing, enabling the athlete to crawl to a road and flag down a passing car to take him to a hospital.
 The grisly attack has alarmed athletes in Durban who routinely get up in the early morning darkness to train when few people are on the roads, and there was no immediate explanation for why Gwala was targeted.
The athlete had offered his cell phone, wallet and bicycle to the assailants, who still went for his legs and were speaking in a language that Gwala could not understand, Jackson said.
 ""I have never heard of any enemies that he may have,"" he said.
""He is a wonderful ambassador for the sport."" Gwala became an excellent athlete after overcoming drug and alcohol addictions, representing South Africa at international competitions in Chicago in 2015 and in the Netherlands last year, Jackson said.
The athlete's long term goals were to compete in half and whole ironman triathlons, which include swimming, cycling and running.
 South Africa's deputy sports minister, Gert Oosthuizen, described the attack on the ""star athlete"" as ""totally unacceptable"" and said police are investigating.
 Triathlete Henri Schoeman, who won bronze for South Africa at the Rio Olympics in 2016, said he wishes Gwala the best on his path to recovery.
 ""How safe are we on SA roads?"" Schoeman said on Twitter.

"," JOHANNESBURG (AP) -- A South African triathlete who suffered severe injuries when attackers cut his legs with a saw says he will focus on recovery so he can run and cycle again, South African media reported Thursday.
 Athlete Mhlengi Gwala told News24 media that he panicked when several attackers pulled him off his bicycle and started cutting his leg, manually using the blade of a chainsaw after it malfunctioned.
 ""I don't know why they would do something like that to me,"" Gwala said a day after several hours of surgery in the city of Durban.
 Gwala said he was training before dawn on Tuesday when the attack happened, and that a doctor told him that the recovery will take six months, according to News24. ""I am not afraid after the attack,"" he said.
""I want to get through recovery and get back on my bike and running.
I don't want to think about anything negative.
"" Police said they have opened a case of attempted murder and that no arrests have been made.
Gwala said one of the men had a gun, according to police.
 ""The suspects fled the scene when they noticed someone was coming and the victim was assisted by security guards who were in the vicinity,"" police said in a statement.
 The sports committee of the South African parliament condemned the attack, saying it undermines the country's goal of building a united South Africa.
 A crowdfunding effort titled ""Get Mhlengi back on his bike"" has been launched.

 The updated sitcom starring Roseanne Barr returned Tuesday, more than two decades after the original ended its hit run.
The hour-long debut episode was watched by 10 percent more viewers than saw the May 1997 finale of ABC's original ""Roseanne."" That's impressive, given the explosion of alternate platforms and series since then and compared to other successful sitcom reboots.
 NBC's ""Will &

30,16394,"['peace deal', 'Sergio Fajardo', 'Humbero de', 'de la', 'la calle', 'million votes', 'peace accord', 'Rodrigo Londono', 'mining exports']"," BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia's former leftist guerrillas face their first electoral test as a political party Sunday in congressional voting also seen as a measure of the strength of the country's factions two months before presidential elections.
 Analysts see the balloting for the Senate and House of Representatives as a test of the democratic viability of the FARC, whose fighters laid down their arms following a historic peace pact last year and converted into a political movement.
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia gave their new party the same FARC initials as the rebel group.
 ""The FARC are in a tough position,"" says Leon Valencia, a former combatant who now directs the Peace and Reconciliation Foundation, a political think tank.
 ""If they get a low turnout, as is expected, their congressmen will be shunned. They will not be seen as true representatives of the people,"" said Valencia, referring to the fact that the FARC is guaranteed 10 seats in congress under the terms of the peace deal that ended more than a half century of brutal conflict.
 Casting a shadow over the FARC's political ambitions is the recent decision to withdraw its candidate from the presidential race for health reasons.
Former rebel leader Rodrigo Londono, more commonly known by nom-de-guerre Timochenko, underwent successful hearth surgery last week and earlier suffered a stroke.
 The ex-rebels have also expressed fears of irregularities in the electoral process and difficulties accessing campaign funds.
Some of Londono's campaign stops had been met with protests.
The FARC's leaders have said that despite these ""obstacles"" they are hoping to prove they have a future in Colombia's political landscape.
 ""There are parts of the country where people support us,"" Pablo Catatumbo, a FARC commander now running for the senate, told Colombia's Caracol Radio.
""In many regions of the country we have been received enthusiastically, with horse parades and motorcycle shows."" Opinion polls and political analysts, however, suggest the composition of Colombia's congress will not change drastically with the former rebels receiving little support.
Center-right parties, whose lists are stacked with regional electoral barons, are expected to take around 60 percent of the seats.
 The Peace and Reconciliation Foundation says that 65 politicians tied to corruption scandals could win seats because of their ability to buy votes in rural and impoverished areas.
 ""This election will help us to measure just how much politics has changed in Colombia,"" Valencia said.
 Many see Sunday's voting mainly as a test of the strength of Colombia's parties ahead of May presidential elections.
 The elections will include two presidential primaries: one for leftist candidates and another for candidates backed by conservative movements.
 Gustavo Petro, a former mayor of Bogota who was a guerrilla fighter in his youth, is widely expected to win the leftist primary.
The conservative primary will likely be won by Ivan Duque, a pro-business candidate and close ally of former President Alvaro Uribe, who has criticized Colombia's government for giving too many legal and political benefits to former rebels, whose formal party name is now the Common Alternative Revolutionary Force, or FARC in Spanish.
 Petro is a fiery orator running on an anti-establishment platform and currently leads presidential polls with support hovering around 25 percent.
He has promised to make Colombia less dependent on oil and mining exports.
But polls in Colombia can be unreliable.
 Presidential elections will take place in Colombia on May 27, but there is a crowded field of candidates and pollsters doubt that any of them will garner enough votes to win the race outright.
The most likely scenario is a runoff in which Petro would face a conservative or centrist candidate.
 In a recent visit to Washington, Petro described himself as someone who is ""outside the establishment."" --- Follow Manuel Rueda on Twitter at: http://www.twitter.com/ruedareport
"," BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombian voters turned to right-wing parties critical of the country's peace deal with the main leftist rebels and knocked the current president's party down in congressional elections, raising questions about the future of the accord.
 Sunday's vote was seen as a barometer for a fiercely contested presidential election in May.
 It was also the first time former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, competed politically since disarming under the 2016 peace deal to end a half century of conflict.
As expected, support for their radical agenda was soundly rejected, with FARC candidates getting less than 0.5 percent of the overall vote.
That means their political party will get only the 10 seats guaranteed them by the peace accord.
 ""The FARC are in a tough spot,"" said Leon Valencia, a former combatant who now runs the Peace and Reconciliation Foundation, a think tank.
""A long war has generated lots of fear and rancor towards them."" By contrast, many of the accord's critics picked up seats, with the Democratic Center party led by former President Alvaro Uribe headed to being the biggest bloc in the Senate.
 Uribe's hand-picked presidential candidate, Sen.
Ivan Duque, easily swept an open primary among three conservative candidates in which more than 5.8 million people voted - a bigger haul than either of the top two finishers got in the first round of the 2014 presidential election.
 President Juan Manuel Santos' coalition, which supported the peace deal, struggled.
His own Party of National Unity, which was the biggest political movement in the outgoing congress, finished fifth overall.
 The results are likely to lead to a last-minute scramble among presidential candidates to form coalitions to better position themselves ahead of what is seen as a wide-open presidential race.
 Two candidates under pressure to join forces are Humberto de la Calle, who was the government's chief peace negotiator, and former Gov.
Sergio Fajardo.
Both candidates have vowed to implement the peace deal.
The Green Alliance, one of the parties supporting Fajardo, doubled its vote tally from the last congressional elections, though it only came in sixth overall this year.
 Another candidate who has backed the peace deal is Gustavo Petro, a leftist former mayor of Bogota who has promised to raise taxes on the rich and unseat the country's political establishment.
Petro won a leftist primary Sunday in which he got 2.8 million votes.
It was 1.2 million votes less than Duque's total but still made him a top presidential contender.
 ""Our results were very positive,"" Petro told his followers.
""The presidential campaign starts today."" Duque has said he would not ""thrash"" the peace accord with the FARC, but he would attempt to modify certain aspects, like a provision that allows the former rebels with drug-trafficking convictions to participate in politics.
He has also called for tougher controls on the FARC's finances.
 ""A true peace is built through the triumph of the rule of law not through the relativization of justice,"" he told his followers after election results came in.
 Sergio Guzman, a political analyst at Control Risks, said that while Duque's vote tally was impressive, it was too early to tell if he will win the May 27 presidential election.
Voters who are critical of the peace deal will be able to choose between Duque and German Vargas Lleras, the conservative leader of the Radical Change party.
The pro peace deal vote is currently split among Gustavo Petro, Sergio Fajardo and Humberto de la Calle.

31,17091,"['Perez Rivera', 'Mujica said', 'filing for asylum', 'daughters', 'single muncipal', 'muncipal police', 'police officer', 'numbers']"," MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A big caravan of Central American migrants that has stirred up concerns in the U.S., including drawing tweets from President Donald Trump, has halted its march for a rest at a sports field in southern Mexico.
 The U.S. leader warned about ""caravans"" of migrants heading to the U.S., and others questioned whether the caravan of approximately 1,100 people was moving across Mexico toward its northern border with the intent of crossing into the United States.
 On Monday, the mass of mostly Hondurans that had been walking along roadsides and train tracks stopped in Oaxaca state at the field, where they are getting advice on filing for transit or humanitarian visas in Mexico.
Many took refuge from the hot afternoon sun by resting in the stands under the awning.
As night fell, the migrants, many with children, lit fires to cook their meager rations.
 A group of a couple hundred men did break off from the march Sunday, hopping a freight train north probably with hopes of trying to enter the U.S.
But the rest seemed unlikely to move again until Wednesday or Thursday, and they probably would take buses to the last scheduled stop for the caravan, a migrant rights symposium in central Puebla state.
 Irineo Mujica, director of Pueblo Sin Fronteras, the activist group behind the annual symbolic event designed to draw attention to the plight of migrants, said the caravan would continue only to Puebla southeast of Mexico City, ""but not in a massive way."" After the symposium, some migrants might go to Mexico's capital, where it is easier to make an asylum claim.
Mujica said about 300 to 400 say they have relatives living in Mexico and so may consider staying here at least temporarily.
 There were reports Mexican officials were seeking to end the caravan, but it was for all intents and purposes over anyway.
The participants were never equipped to march en masse to the U.S. border or anywhere near it.
 The ""Stations of the Cross"" caravans have been held annually in southern Mexico for about 10 years.
They began as short processions of migrants, some dressed in biblical garb and carrying crosses, as an Easter-season protest against the kidnappings, extortion, beatings and killings suffered by many Central American migrants as they cross Mexico.
 The organized portions of the caravans usually have not gone much farther north than the Gulf coast state of Veracruz, although some participants have then gone off by bus or truck to the U.S. border, moving as individuals or in small groups.
 This year's event seems to have gotten more notice in the U.S., and Trump has sent some angry tweets that raised hackles in Mexico.
 ""Mexico is doing very little, if not NOTHING, at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border, and then into the U.S.
They laugh at our dumb immigration laws.
They must stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash cow, NAFTA.
NEED WALL!"" Trump wrote in one. ""With all of the money they make from the U.S., hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours.
"" Mexico's interior secretary, Alfonso Navarrete Prida, rejected such pressure.
 ""We will act with complete sovereignty in enforcing our laws,"" he said Monday.
""Of course we will act ... to enforce our immigration laws, with no pressure whatsoever from any country whatsoever."" In a statement late Monday, Mexico's government said about 400 participants in the caravan had already been sent back to their home countries.
""Under no circumstances does the Mexican government promote irregular migration,"" the Interior Ministry statement said.
 But it added that Mexico considers the annual caravans to be ""a public demonstration that seeks to call attention to the migration phenomenon and the importance of respecting the rights of Central Americans."" The U.S. government has been kept fully informed of the situation, it said.
 The department also said that unlike in previous years of the caravan, ""this time Mexican immigration authorities have offered refugee status"" to participants who qualify.
But it suggested it is not up to Mexico to keep people from going to the U.S. to apply for asylum.
 ""It is not this government's responsibility to make immigration decisions for the United States or any other country, so it will be up to the appropriate authorities of the United States to decide whether to authorize the entry of the caravan participants to U.S. territory,"" the statement said.
 Navarette Prida had said earlier that he talked with U.S.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Monday about handling migration, ""in accordance with each country's laws.
"" Nielsen later tweeted that their talk focused specifically on the annual migrant caravan.
""Working with Mexican officials to address the yearly illegal alien caravan. Exploring all options,"" she wrote.
 Mexico routinely stops and deports Central Americans, sometimes in numbers that rival those of the United States.
Deportations of foreigners dropped from 176,726 in 2015 to 76,433 in 2017, in part because fewer were believed to have come to Mexico, and more were requesting asylum in Mexico.
 Mexico granted 3,223 asylum requests made in 2016, and 9,626 requests filed last year are either under review or have been accepted.

"," MATIAS ROMERO, Mexico (AP) -- The caravan of Central American migrants that angered U.S.
President Donald Trump was sidelined at a sports field in southern Mexico with no means of reaching the border even as Trump tweeted another threat to Mexico Tuesday.
 ""The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our ""Weak Laws"" Border, had better be stopped before it gets there,"" Trump wrote.
""Cash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen."" The caravan that once numbered 1,150 or more people actually halted days ago in the town of Matias Romero in the southern state of Oaxaca, where participants slept out in the open.
After days of walking along roadsides and train tracks, the organizers now plan to try to get buses to take participants to the final event, an immigrants' rights conference in the central state of Puebla later this week.
 Bogged down by logistical problems, large numbers of children and fears about people getting sick, the caravan was always meant to draw attention to the plight of migrants and was never equipped to march all the way to the U.S. border.
 ""The idea was never for this group of people to reach the border. It was more to achieve a sensible and clear solution"" to migrants' need to leave their countries, said Irineo Mujica, director of Pueblo Sin Fronteras, the activist group behind the annual symbolic event.
 With conditions bad in Honduras following that country's hotly disputed November presidential elections, unexpectedly large numbers of people showed for this year's march.
 ""We have never seen a march of this size. It is unmanageable,"" Mujica said.
 On Tuesday, the group - mostly Hondurans - spread out on blankets in walkways between buildings, on playing fields and on grassy spots between swing sets.
Young children kicked soccer balls through the dust and climbed on resting parents, killing time.
Adults gathered around the few power outlets to charge cellphones.
A single municipal police officer kept watch.
 Women and children picked through piles of donated clothing, as volunteers ladled water boiled over a fire into cups with instant coffee and instant noodles.
 Aida Raquel Perez Rivera, 31, from San Pedro Sula - one of Honduras' most violent cities - was sitting on a rolled blanket in the shade.
She said she hopes for asylum in the United States because the father of her daughters is trying to kill her.
 ""I have been threatened with death and I had to leave my daughters back there,"" said Perez Rivera.
""I left without money, without anything, just the clothes on my back."" Perez Rivera said she joined the caravan because there was safety in numbers.
She said she is also considering seeking asylum in Mexico, but worries she couldn't support her daughters from Mexico.
 On Monday, Mexican immigration officials began taking the names of people interested in filing for asylum, or temporary transit or humanitarian visas in Mexico.
 But Mujica said he didn't know ""if that was just to calm down Donald Trump's tweets, or calm down Donald Trump.
"" He said the group was waiting for the migration officers to return.
 About 150 men already did break off from the march Sunday, hopping a freight train north, probably with hopes of trying to enter the U.S. But the rest of the migrants at the camp seemed unlikely to move again until Wednesday or Thursday.
Mujica said about 300 to 400 say they have relatives living in Mexico and so may consider staying here at least temporarily.
 The ""Stations of the Cross"" caravans have been held annually in southern Mexico for about 10 years.
They began as short processions of migrants, some dressed in biblical garb and carrying crosses, as an Easter-season protest against the kidnappings, extortion, beatings and killings suffered by many Central American migrants as they cross Mexico.
 The organized portions of the caravans usually have not gone much farther north than the Gulf coast state of Veracruz.
 This year's event seems to have gotten more notice in the U.S., and Trump has sent some angry tweets that raised hackles in Mexico, which in recent years has detained and deported hundreds of thousands of Central American migrants before they could reach the U.S. border.
 ""Mexico is doing very little, if not NOTHING, at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border, and then into the U.S.
They laugh at our dumb immigration laws.
They must stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash cow, NAFTA.
NEED WALL!"" Trump wrote in one. ""With all of the money they make from the U.S., hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours.
"" In a statement late Monday, Mexico's government said about 400 participants in the caravan had already been sent back to their home countries.
""Under no circumstances does the Mexican government promote irregular migration,"" the Interior Ministry statement said.
 The department also said that unlike in previous yearly caravans, ""this time Mexican immigration authorities have offered refugee status"" to participants who qualify.

32,18027,"['Brjawi', ' reformulated electoral', 'electoral law', 'proportional representation', 'polling stations', 'Streets were festooned', 'percent']"," BEIRUT (AP) -- Tens of thousands of Lebanese began casting their ballots Sunday in the first parliamentary elections in nine years, with people lining up early in the morning to take part in a vote that is being fiercely contested between rival groups backed by regional powers.
 The voting is unlikely to change the existing balance of power among the major groups in Lebanon, but many hope new contenders from civil society groups can challenge the decades-old sectarian political system.
 Thousands of army and police forces deployed near polling stations and on major intersections across the country to ensure security.
Electoral campaigns have been tense as each group has mobilized its supporters, with fist fights and shootings occurring in several areas in recent weeks.
 The main race is between a Western and Saudi-backed coalition headed by Prime Minister Saad Hariri and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, part of a region-wide struggle for power between Riyadh and Tehran.
 ""This shows Lebanon's democracy and the importance of democracy.
This is a democratic wedding, and as we said from the start, congratulations to whoever wins tonight,"" said Interior Minister Nouhad Machnouk, who is running on Hariri's list, after casting his ballot in Beirut.
 As Hariri entered a public school to vote, a woman in a wheelchair complained that polling stations were not equipped for disabled voters.
 ""We are human beings. It is not fair that we have to be carried like bags of potatoes,"" the woman, Silvana Lakkis, said.
The prime minister promised to address the problem in the next elections.
 ""When we see what is happening in countries around us and Lebanon is holding democratic elections, this shows that Lebanon is fine,"" Hariri said after waiting in line around 20 minutes to cast his ballot.
""Order is nice,"" he quipped.
 The vote is the first since Syria's war broke out in 2011, sending a flood of around million refugees to neighboring Lebanon and adding to the country's economic woes.
 Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to back President Bashar Assad's forces, a move that has been criticized by many Lebanese, mainly Sunni Muslims and Christians, who see the group as dragging the country into regional conflicts.
 Leading Hezbollah legislator Ali Ammar defended his group's involvement in Syria, saying it protected Lebanon from the ""evil powers"" of the Islamic State group and al-Qaida.
 In Hezbollah strongholds in southern Beirut, there was a steady flow of voters Sunday.
Outside polling stations, Hezbollah supporters displayed a replica of the voting ballot on a big board and explained to voters which among the color-coded lists is theirs, and how they can vote for it.
They wore yellow shirts with the slogan ""We protect and build"" written on them.
 ""We love the resistance,"" said Amira Sidani, an 85-year-old woman, after casting her ballot.
 This year's vote is according to a new election law that is based on proportional representation.
Voters will choose one list of allied candidates, as well as a preferred candidate from among them.
In the past, the winning list took all the seats in the electoral district.
 At midday, after casting his ballot in southern Beirut, President Michel Aoun described the process as ""successful."" Wary of voters' apathy toward a vote unlikely to change much, he urged people to turn out in large numbers.
 Mohammed Ali, 30, riding his scooter to the beach, said he's not voting because there are no choices.
He says his family members will vote for whoever pays them, but he's not interested in the money.
 The legislature's term was supposed to expire in 2013, but lawmakers have approved several extensions since then, citing security concerns linked to the spillover from Syria's war.
Lebanese who support opposing sides in the war have clashed on a number of occasions, and Sunni extremists have carried out several bombings.
 There are about 3.6 million eligible voters, and early results are expected after polling stations close at 7 p.m. (1600 GMT).
Some 586 candidates, including 86 women, are running for the 128-seat parliament, which is equally divided between Muslims and Christians.
 Hezbollah and its allies are likely to add more seats, while Hariri is likely to lose several.
Some of his Sunni supporters see him as being too soft on Hezbollah, and the billionaire businessman has also faced criticism after laying off scores of employees from his companies in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia.
 Still, Hariri will most likely be named to form a national unity Cabinet after the vote.
The rival sides are expected to recreate the unity government that currently exists, which includes Hezbollah.
 The vote comes a week after Lebanese living oversees voted in 39 countries around the world.
It was the first time Lebanon's large expatriate community was allowed to take part in the vote.
That, along with the new electoral law, has injected some unpredictability to the process.

"," BEIRUT (AP) -- Lebanon's first national elections in nine years were marked by a tepid turnout Sunday, reflecting voter frustration over endemic corruption and a stagnant economy.
 Politicians had urged citizens to vote, and security forces struggled to maintain order as fights broke out in and around polling stations.
 President Michel Aoun broadcast an appeal to voters to participate in a televised address an hour before polls closed in the evening.
""If you want change, you should exercise your right"" to vote, he said in a message published on Twitter at the same time.
 The elections were the first since war broke out in neighboring Syria in 2011, sending over one million refugees to Lebanon, a small country with a population estimated at around 4.5 million.
The war has divided the country, pitting parties supporting the Iran-sponsored Hezbollah's intervention in Syria to aid President Bashar Assad against Saudi-aligned parties opposed to it.
 Early results were expected to start coming in late Sunday, but official results were not expected to be announced before Monday.
 The low turnout - between 32 percent and 42 percent in Beirut precincts, according to Interior Minister Nouhad Machnouk - betrayed widespread voter apathy for the main political currents governing the country and left open the possibility that outside candidates could win seats in Parliament.
 Machnouk put national turnout at 49 percent, compared to 54 percent in 2009.
The drop came despite a reformulated electoral law designed to encourage voting through proportional representation.
 ""These leaders are destroying homes, not building them,"" said Ahmad Khashouq, 43, a private security guard in Beirut.
Khashouq, from the town of Zahle in the country's Bekaa Valley, said he was not voting in the elections after feeling his vote was wasted in 2009, the last time elections were held.
 More than 500 candidates ran for 128 seats in Lebanon's National Assembly.
 Fist fights broke out in and around polling stations around the country, as rival partisans accused each other and election officials of ballot stuffing and illegal campaigning.
In the Choueifat district, a crowd inside a station accused the station supervisor of illegal voting practices and smashed a ballot box, spilling its contents across the floor.
The army ordered the media to turn off their cameras.
 In Zahle, politician Mryiam Skaff accused members of the right-wing Lebanese Forces party of beating up her supporters in polling stations.
 The voting was unlikely to change the existing balance of power among the major political factions in Lebanon, but many hoped new contenders from civil society groups could challenge the decades-old sectarian political system.
 Sarah Brjawi, 33, said she was voting for Nouhad Yazbek, a woman running on a coalition list of political independents and activists running in Beirut.
 Brjawi, who walked the streets of Beirut's Ras el-Nabea neighborhood with her clown troupe before voting, said she was perplexed by voters who said they supported their satirical act, poking fun at the country's endemic corruption and political stagnation, while saying they would vote for establishment parties again.
 ""This country is really bipolar,"" said Brjawi.
 The main race was between a Western and Saudi-backed coalition headed by Prime Minister Saad Hariri and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, part of a region-wide power struggle that is tearing apart the Middle East.
 ""This shows Lebanon's democracy and the importance of democracy.
This is a democratic wedding, and as we said from the start, congratulations to whoever wins tonight,"" Machnouk, the interior minister who was a candidate on Hariri's list, said after casting his ballot in Beirut.

Voters chose one list of allied candidates as well as a preferred candidate from among them.
In the past, the winning list took all the seats in an electoral district.
 The change cracked open the door for more outsiders to compete in elections, challenging political titans who have long ruled Lebanon based on a sectarian and family patronage system.

He said his relatives vote for whoever pays them, but he was not interested in the money.

 Videos posted online show officers handcuffing the men in the downtown establishment on Thursday.
A white man in the video is heard saying he was meeting with the men and calls the arrest ""ridiculous."" Commissioner Richard Ross said Starbucks employees called 911 to say the men were trespassing.
He said officers were told that the men had come in and asked to use the restroom but were denied because they hadn't bought anything, as he said is company policy.
He said they then refused to leave.
 Ross, who is black, said police asked the men to leave three times but they refused, and they were then arrested but were later released after the company elected not to prosecute.
He said the officers ""did absolutely nothing wrong"" and were professional in their conduct toward the individuals but ""got the opposite back."" He did not mention the person who said he was meeting with the men.
 ""As an African American male, I am very aware of implicit bias;
we are committed to fair and unbiased policing,"" Ross said. But he added ""If a business calls and they say that 'Someone is here that I no longer wish to be in my business'
(officers) now have a legal obligation to carry out their duties and they did just that.
"" Starbucks posted an apology on Twitter Saturday, saying the company was ""disappointed this led to an arrest"" and was reviewing its policies.
 ""We take these matters seriously and clearly have more work to do when it comes to how we handle incidents in our store,"" the company said in a statement Saturday afternoon.
 Ross said he doesn't patronize Starbucks but recalled an incident from a few years ago in which a uniformed sergeant was denied access to a Starbucks bathroom ""so they are at least consistent in their policy."" Mayor Jim Kenney said he asked the city Commission on Human Relations to examine the company's policies and procedures ""including the extent of, or need for, implicit bias training for its employees."" ""I am heartbroken to see Philadelphia in the headlines for an incident that - at least based on what we know at this point - appears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018,"" Kenney said in a statement.
 Kenney said a review promised by police of policies in similar situations ""is fully warranted given the unfortunate outcome of this event, particularly at a time when our criminal justice reform efforts are focused on avoiding needless incarcerations."" Attorney Lauren Wimmer told The Philadelphia Inquirer that the men, who she did not identify, were commercial real estate professionals and were meeting with the another man to discuss business.
She identified herself as a friend of the man they were meeting with.

34,17576,"['$500 million', 'Wells Fargo', 'Federal Reserve', 'Bank regulatros', 'abusive practices', 'CFPB', 'Time Sloan']"," NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal regulators plan to fine Wells Fargo as much as $1 billion as early as Friday for abuses tied to its auto-lending and mortgage businesses, The New York Times and other news outlets reported, citing unnamed sources.
 The potential $1 billion fine would be largest ever imposed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the bank's main national regulator, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the federal watchdog bureau set up after the Great Recession.
 The fine against Wells Fargo had been expected.
San Francisco-based Wells Fargo said last week that it was negotiating with federal regulators to pay as much as $1 billion in fines to settle various charges.
 A CFPB spokesman declined to comment, as well as a spokesman for the Comptroller's Office.
A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo also declined to comment.
 The problems with Wells Fargo this time are not tied directly to its well-known sales-practices scandal, where the bank admitted its employees opened as many as 3.5 million bank and credit card accounts without getting customers' authorization.
But they do involve to significant parts of the bank's businesses: auto lending and mortgages.
 Last summer, Wells Fargo admitted that hundreds of thousands of its auto-loan customers had been sold auto insurance that they did not want or need.
In thousands of cases, customers who could not afford the combined auto-loan and extra insurance payment fell behind on their payments and had their cars repossessed.
 In a separate case, Wells Fargo also admitted that thousands of customers were charged unnecessary fees in order to lock in their interest rates on their home mortgages.
Wells Fargo is the nation's largest mortgage lender.
 This would be the first fine against a bank by the Trump administration since Mick Mulvaney, acting director of the CFPB, took over the bureau in late-November.
 While banks have benefited from looser regulations and lower taxes under President Donald Trump, Wells Fargo has been called out specifically by Trump as a bank that needs to be punished for its bad behavior.
 ""Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped, as has incorrectly been reported, but will be pursued and, if anything, substantially increased. I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!"" Trump wrote on Twitter back in December.

"," NEW YORK (AP) -- Wells Fargo will pay $1 billion to federal regulators to settle charges tied to misconduct at its mortgage and auto lending business, the latest punishment levied against the banking giant for widespread customer abuses.
 In a settlement announced Friday, Wells will pay $500 million to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, its main national bank regulator, as well as a net $500 million to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
The fine is the largest ever imposed by the CFPB and its first since the Trump administration took control of the bureau in late November.
 Starting in September 2016, Wells has admitted to a number of abusive practices across multiple parts of its business that duped consumers out of millions of dollars.
Regulators, in turn, have fined Wells several times and put unprecedented restrictions on its ability to do business, including forcing the bank to replace directors on its board.
Even President Trump, whose administration has been keenly focused on paring back financial regulations, has called out Wells for its ""bad acts."" In Friday's announcement, the CFPB and the OCC penalized Wells for improperly charging fees to borrowers who wanted to lock in an interest rate on a pending mortgage loan and for sticking auto loan customers with insurance policies they didn't want or need.
The bank admitted that tens of thousands of customers who could not afford the combined auto loan and extra insurance payment fell behind on their payments and had their cars repossessed.
 These abuses are separate from Wells Fargo's well-known sales practices scandal, where employees opened as many as 3.5 million bank and credit card accounts without getting customers' authorization.
The account scandal torpedoed Wells Fargo's reputation as the nation's best-run bank.
 In that case, Wells Fargo paid a combined $187 million in fines and penalties to federal regulators, including the CFPB, and the Los Angeles City Attorney's office, and the company's then-CEO John Stumpf stepped down after being bashed by politicians on both side of the aisle.
 Even with the latest settlement, Wells Fargo isn't in the clear.
Its wealth management business is reportedly under investigation for improprieties similar to those that impacted its consumer bank.
And the Department of Justice is investigating the bank's currency trading business.
 The $500 million paid to the Comptroller of the Currency will go directly to the U.S.
Treasury, according to the order.
The $500 million paid to the CFPB will go into the bureau's civil penalties fund, which is used to help consumers who might have been harmed in other cases.
Wells has previously said it began reimbursing auto loan and mortgage customers last year.
 The settlement imposes further restrictions on Wells Fargo's business, a sign that regulators have lost patience with the bank's promises to turn itself around.
Wells will need to come up with a risk management plan to be approved by bank regulators, and get approval from bank regulators before hiring senior employees.
The OCC said in a statement that one reason for the size of the fine against Wells was ""the bank's failure to correct the deficiencies and violations in a timely manner.
"" The $500 million fine matches the largest fine ever handed out by the Comptroller of the Currency against HSBC in 2012. The Federal Reserve cracked down on Wells earlier this year by restricting it from growing larger than the $1.95 trillion in assets that it held at the time and requiring the bank to replace several directors on its board.
The Federal Reserve cited ""widespread abuses"" for taking such an action.
 ""While we have more work to do, these orders affirm that we share the same priorities with our regulators and that we are committed to working with them as we deliver our commitments with focus, accountability, and transparency,"" said Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan in a statement Friday.
 The action by the CFPB is notable because the penalty is the first imposed by the bureau under Mick Mulvaney, appointed by President Trump to take over the consumer watchdog agency in late November.
The largest fine previously handed down by the CFPB was a $100 million penalty also against Wells Fargo.
 While banks have benefited from looser regulations and lower taxes under President Trump, Wells Fargo has been called out specifically by Trump as a bank that needed to be punished for its bad behavior.
 ""Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped, as has incorrectly been reported, but will be pursued and, if anything, substantially increased. I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!,"" Trump wrote on Twitter back in December.
 The White House said that, outside of his tweet, President Trump was not involved in the Wells Fargo investigation or settlement.
 Consumer advocates have been critical of the Trump administration's record since it took over the CFPB.
However, advocates were pleased to see Wells Fargo held to account.
 ""Today's billion dollar fine is an important development and a fitting penalty given the severity of Wells Fargo's fraudulent and abusive practices,"" said Pamela Banks, senior policy counsel for Consumers Union.
 On Friday, Wells Fargo adjusted its previously reported first-quarter earnings to reflect the penalty.
The nation's third-largest bank now says it made $4.7 billion in the first 90 days of the year, down from $5.46 billion in the same period a year earlier.

 Scientists meeting in Colombia looked at shrinking biodiversity in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Africa.
They report Friday that nowhere is doing well.
 Study team chairman Robert Watson says shrinking biodiversity means less food and clean water for people.
 The reports project that by the year 2050, if current trends continue, the Americas will have 15 percent fewer plants and animals than now.
 They forecast that in Asia there will be no fish stocks for commercial fishing by 2048. Scientists say that 28 percent of the species that live only in Europe are threatened now.
 The reports say Africa could lose half of some bird and mammal species by 2100.
"," WASHINGTON (AP) -- Earth is losing plants, animals and clean water at a dramatic rate, according to four new United Nations scientific reports that provide the most comprehensive and localized look at the state of biodiversity.
 Scientists meeting in Colombia issued four regional reports Friday on how well animal and plants are doing in the Americas;
Europe and Central Asia;
Africa;
and the Asia-Pacific area.
 Their conclusion after three years of study : Nowhere is doing well.
 The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem was about more than just critters, said study team chairman Robert Watson.
It is about keeping Earth livable for humans, because we rely on biodiversity for food, clean water and public health, the prominent British and U.S. scientist said.
 ""This is undermining well-being across the planet, threatening us long-term on food and water,"" Watson said in an interview.
 Scientists pointed to this week's death of the last male northern white rhino in Africa, severe declines in the numbers of elephants, tigers and pangolins, but said those are only the most visible and charismatic of species that are in trouble.
 What's happening is a side effect of the world getting wealthier and more crowded with people, Watson said.
Humans need more food, more clean water, more energy and more land.
And the way society has tried to achieve that has cut down on biodiversity, he said.
 Crucial habitat has been cut apart, alien species have invaded places, chemicals have hurt plants and animals, wetlands and mangroves that clean up pollution are disappearing, and the world's waters are overfished, he said.
 Man-made climate change is getting worse, and global warming will soon hurt biodiversity as much as all the other problems combined, Watson said.
 ""We keep making choices to borrow from the future to live well today,"" said Jake Rice, Canada's chief government scientist for fisheries and oceans, who co-chaired the Americas report.
 Duke University conservationist Stuart Pimm, who wasn't part of the study team, said the reports make sense and are based on well-established scientific data: ""Are things pretty dire?
Yes.
"" Among the regional findings: THE AMERICAS If current trends continue, by the year 2050 the Americas will have 15 percent fewer plants and animals than now.
That means there will be 40 percent fewer plants and animals in the Americas than in the early 1700s.
 Nearly a quarter of the species that were fully measured are now threatened, Rice said.
 And when all of ""nature's contributions"" are taken into account, nearly two-thirds are declining and more than one-fifth are ""decreasing strongly,"" Rice said.
 ASIA-PACIFIC If trends continue, there will be no ""exploitable fish stocks"" for commercial fishing by 2048.
Around that same, the region will lose 45 percent of its biodiversity and about 90 percent of its crucial corals, if nothing changes, said Asia co-chair Sonali Seneratna Sellamuttu, a senior researcher at the International Water Management Institute.
 ""All major ecosystems are threatened in the region,"" she said.
 EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA Even though it is the region that Watson said may be doing the best, 28 percent of the species that only live in Europe are now threatened.
In the last decade, 42 percent of the land plant and animal species have declined, said Europe co-chair Mark Rounsevell of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany.
 Wetlands have been cut in half since 1970. AFRICA Africa could lose half of some bird and mammal species by 2100.
And more than 60 percent of the continent's people depend on natural resources for their livelihoods, said report co-chair Luthando Dziba of South African National Parks.
 Already more than 20 percent of Africa's species are threatened, endangered or extinct.
 While scientists said government and society needs to change its ways, individuals can use less energy, less water and eat less red meat, Watson said.
 ""A balanced diet can really help,"" he said.
There are ""lots of individual things you can do."" The outlook is bleak if society doesn't change, but it still can, Watson said.
 ""Some species are threatened with extinctions. Others, just pure numbers will go down,"" Watson said.
""It will be a lonelier place relative to our natural world.
It's a moral issue.
Do we humans have right to make them go extinct.

36,17602,"['vegetable', 'contaminated vegetables', 'officals have not found', 'not found origin', 'toss any romaine', '']"," PHOENIX (AP) -- The U.S.
Centers for Disease expanded its warning Friday surrounding a multistate E. coli outbreak tied to tainted romaine lettuce from Arizona, which has now sickened more than 50 people.
 The agency said information from new cases of illness prompted them to caution against eating any forms of romaine lettuce that may have come from Yuma.
Previously, CDC officials had only warned against chopped romaine by itself or as part of salads and salad mixes.
But they are now extending the risk to heads or hearts of romaine lettuce.
 People at an Alaska correctional facility recently reported feeling ill after eating from whole heads of romaine lettuce.
The vegetable was traced to lettuce harvested in the Yuma region, according to the CDC.
 So far, the outbreak has infected 53 people in 16 states.
At least 31 have been hospitalized, including five with kidney failure.
No deaths have been reported.
 Symptoms of E. coli infection include diarrhea, severe stomach cramps and vomiting.
 The CDC's updated advisory said consumers nationwide should not buy or eat romaine lettuce from a grocery store or restaurant unless they can get confirmation that it did not come from Yuma.
Restaurants and retailers are also being warned not to serve or sell romaine lettuce from the area.
 According to the Produce Marketing Association, romaine grown in coastal and Central California, Florida and central Mexico is not at risk.
 Yuma is roughly 185 miles (298 kilometers) southwest of Phoenix and close to the California border.
The region, referred to as the country's ""winter vegetable capital,"" is known for its agriculture and often revels in it with events like a lettuce festival.
 Steve Alameda, president of the Yuma Fresh Vegetable Association which represents local growers, said the outbreak has weighed heavily on him and other farmers.
 ""We want to know what happened,"" Alameda said.
""We can't afford to lose consumer confidence.
It's heartbreaking to us.
We take this very personally.
"" Growers in Yuma typically plant romaine lettuce between September and January.
During the peak of the harvest season, which runs from mid-November until the beginning of April, the Yuma region supplies most of the romaine sold in the U.S., according to Alameda.
The outbreak came as the harvest of romaine was already near its end.
 While Alameda has not met with anyone from the CDC, he is reviewing his own business.
He is going over food safety practices and auditing operations in the farming fields.

37,17348,"['computer screen', 'television', 'soon', 'expand', 'happy and so excited', 'boutique', 'firm dates', 'presence', '']"," LONDON (AP) -- Canadian fashion designer Bojana Sentaler stared at her television on Christmas Day to see if Meghan Markle had a gift for her.
 She did.
As Prince Harry's future bride left a church service on the grounds of Queen Elizabeth II's private country estate, Sentaler spotted a cuff detail on Markle's camel alpaca coat that told her customers would be flocking to her website.
 ""I was looking for the ribbed sleeves, hoping it was a Sentaler coat,"" said the designer, who met Markle when she was a mere TV star.
""And as soon as I saw that, I was so happy and so excited and it was the best Christmas present I could ever wish for."" The Meghan magic was almost instantaneous;
Markle's coat sold out, as Sentaler expected, and the publicity fueled sales of other designs.
Now part of an elite circle of entrepreneurs tapped with the monarchy's golden touch, the designer plans a boutique in London, though no firm dates are set.
 Markle's marriage to Harry isn't just a trans-Atlantic love story linking the House of Windsor to Hollywood.
The couple's May 19 wedding is likely to have dividends for the designers, florists, bakers and tiara makers who are directly part of it, as well as for businesses much farther down the line of affection.
 The glamorous bride-to-be alone is forecast to pump 150 million pounds ($210 million) into the British economy as consumers try to mimic her style, according to economists at Brand Finance, which produces an annual report on the monarchy's economic contributions.
 In all, the wedding is expected to generate more than 1 billion pounds of economic activity, including 300 million pounds in tourism, particularly from Americans eager to be part of the occasion.
 Marketers see Markle as a bonus from the royal family, since her engagement to Harry followed so closely on the sensible but very stylish heel of the former Kate Middleton, who married Prince William seven years ago.
 But Markle, whose pencil skirts and stiletto heels graced the hit U.S. television show ""Suits"" for seven years, brings fresh sparkle to the picture.
Having her showcase a coat, handbag or service is like being associated with a fairy tale, just like when Grace Kelly married Prince Rainier III of Monaco in 1956. Perhaps more importantly, she's a biracial American who links the royal family to new countries and new cultures.
 ""The U.S. loves a princess,"" said Pauline MacLaran, co-author of ""Royal Fever: The British Monarch in Consumer Culture.
"" ""It's something that the U.S. does not have.
It's the rags-to-riches story.
It's the whole Cinderella story yet again.
"" The back story makes Markle of huge interest not just to Americans - who sometimes seem more fascinated by the royals than their own subjects - but also other royalty-loving countries like Japan, which marvels at the Windsors moving into the 21st century.
 ""The last time there was something like this was when Grace married Rainier, and he was just a petty potentate,"" said David Haigh of Brand Finance.
 The royals don't advertise, but they do set trends and showcase whatever they might be wearing, seeing or doing.
Whether it was Queen Victoria popularizing trees for Victorian Christmases or Princess Diana and her ruffle collars, people have long tried to emulate their style.
 But these days, the royal effect is supercharged by social media.
The internet offers a running commentary on everything the royals do, and their fashion choices are photographed, scrutinized and instantly identified.
Websites such as whatkatewore.com and its sister site, whatmeghanwore.net quickly pinpoint the designer and sometimes tell a bit of a garment's story.
 When Meghan wore The Dina style jean from the Hiut Denim Company, there was worldwide publicity about a firm in Wales which started to re-employ workers displaced when the local factory closed.
Handbag designer Charlotte Elizabeth, a small firm supported by The Prince's Trust charity, warns of long waits and unprecedented demand now that Markle is part of the equation.
 American Susan Kelley, founder of whatkatewore.com, said Markle has proved to be more cognizant of the impact of her choices than the Duchess of Cambridge.
That may be because as a former actress, she brings to her new public role a greater sensitivity to the messages sartorial selections contain.
 ""I think Meghan understands sartorial diplomacy and understands it to the level that she wants to expose smaller artisanal brands to the general public,"" Kelley said.
""It's a tremendous economic driver, a tourism driver and a platform to draw attention to the charitable endeavors they think are important.
"" Anyone who has been sucked into this vortex can vouch for the impact of even an unplanned product sighting.

 After the world got a 45-second look at newborn Prince George in one of the company's signature muslin swaddles five years ago, aden + anais' website crashed within four hours.
The next day, the site crashed again, Moya-Jones recalled.
The company had 7,000 orders - a 600 percent increase in sales - in nine days for the ""royal swaddle"" that popped up in search engines.

38,17238,"['68', 'year', 'old', 'former Republican', 'democratic']"," OMAHA, Nebraska (AP) -- Just 18 months after declaring his opposition to banning assault weapons, Nebraska Democrat Brad Ashford has changed his mind.
 The former one-term congressman, now trying to win back an Omaha-area seat he lost in 2016, used to consider it futile to push for a ban while Republicans held power on Capitol Hill.
But the student activism that has followed the rampage at a school in Parkland, Florida, has changed his thinking in a way that other high-profile shootings, including two in his hometown since 2007, had not.
 Ashford's conversion mirrors the one underway in his party.
Not long ago, a moderate record on guns would have been considered a plus for a Democratic candidate in the GOP-leaning suburbs and conservative outskirts of Nebraska's largest city.
Today, even with Ashford's reversal, it's a vulnerability that his opponent in the May 15 Democratic primary has been quick to exploit.
 That contest, along with races in Virginia, rural Pennsylvania and other places where gun control has been taboo, shows how far the Democratic Party has traveled on this issue.
The November elections will test whether Democrats will make room for candidates who don't back all gun control measures.
 ""He should have been stronger on this,"" said Kara Eastman, the 46-year-old political newcomer running against Ashford for the nomination in the 2nd Congressional District.
""We need leaders who are going to stand up and fight for the kids."" Eastman, director of a children's nonprofit group and a community college board member, has focused her message on suburban women and young people.
She and other progressives, energized by rallies across the country, say they the best way to turn out voters is to offer a contrast to pro-gun Republicans.
 ""Women have had it with what's going on,"" said Crystal Rhoades, the Douglas County Democratic Party chairwoman who supports Eastman. ""They're mad that they have to worry about sending their kids to school out of fear they'll be murdered.
"" Polling shows there's little disagreement among Democrats on the question of stricter gun laws.
 A poll last month by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 69 percent of those surveyed, including 90 percent of Democrats, think gun laws in the U.S. should be tightened.
 There are political risks.
 The Omaha district represented by Republican Don Bacon has a healthy number of gun owners, and that could make Eastman's call for comprehensive gun control a problem for her if she advances to the general election.
The GOP-leaning district includes a portion of a rural county south of the city where many active duty and retired military personnel from Offutt Air Force Base live.
 ""I don't think their mindset has changed.
If you're pro-gun, you're still pro-gun,"" said Charlene Ligon, the Democratic chairwoman in rural Sarpy County. ""And there are a lot of people with guns around here.
"" In a northern Virginia swing district, all six Democrats who hope to challenge the Republican incumbent, Barbara Comstock, want to ban assault rifles and expand background checks for gun buyers.
In 2016, Comstock's Democratic opponent endorsed only modest changes.
 Last month, Democrat Conor Lamb won a special congressional election in southwestern Pennsylvania in which he advocated expanded background checks, a once disqualifying position in a district that Donald Trump won by 20 percentage points in 2016. Lamb stopped short of embracing an assault weapons ban, though Sen.
Bob Casey, D-Pa.
, has joined the call.
And longtime gun advocate Joe Manchin, a Democratic senator from West Virginia, led an unsuccessful effort to expand background checks in 2015. ""It certainly seems to be a realignment of what was viewed as politically expedient,"" said Andrew Patrick of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.
""This is no longer a liability for Democrats."" While Nebraska's Ashford advocated some gun control measures during two terms in the state Legislature, he said during a 2016 debate with Bacon, ""I don't think we should ban assault weapons.
"" In Washington, Ashford did not join lawmakers from both parties in backing legislation to expand background checks, saying any gun measures would have proved futile in the GOP-controlled House.
Nor did he go along with about 150 Democratic co-sponsors on a measure to ban assault rifles after the shooting in San Bernardino, California, in 2015. ""I had no belief that putting a lot of effort in an assault weapons ban would get us anywhere,"" Ashford said in an Associated Press interview.
""I had sort of lost faith in our ability to ever get there."" The students in Florida and elsewhere who mobilized after the Parkland shooting have changed Ashford's mind.
 ""The Parkland thing, now I just feel reinvigorated, and I would vote for an assault weapons ban, today,"" he said.
 Eastman, his primary opponent, is keeping the pressure on.
 She accuses Ashford of being on both sides of the issue at a time when voters, especially young people and parents, demand action.
And she's ready to delivery, saying she supports an assault weapons ban, universal background checks and an automatic waiting period between purchase and delivery.
 ""I'm talking to voters, they are frustrated with that and are looking for someone who stands by their convictions,"" she said.

39,16832,"['confetti-covered', 'halftime', 'Wolverines beat', 'Florida State', '58-54']"," ATLANTA (AP) -- Porter Moser stood in front of the scarf-clad Loyola cheering section, a bit dazed but beaming from ear to ear.
 ""Are you kidding me!
Are you kidding me,"" the Ramblers coach screamed over and over.
 No kidding.
 Loyola is headed to the Final Four .
 An improbable NCAA Tournament took its craziest turn yet Saturday night, when Ben Richardson scored a career-high 23 points and the 11th-seeded Ramblers romped to a 78-62 victory over Kansas State to cap off a stunning run through the bracket-busting South Regional.
 The Ramblers (32-5) matched the lowest-seeded team ever to reach the Final Four, joining LSU (1986), George Mason (2006) and VCU (2011).
Those other three all lost in the national semifinals.
 Don't bet against Loyola, which emerged from a regional that produced a staggering array of upsets.
The South became the first regional in tournament history to have the top four seeds - including overall No. 1 Virginia - knocked out on the opening weekend.
 In the end, it was the Ramblers cutting down the nets.
 After three close calls, this one was downright easy.
 ""We believed that we could do something like this - do something really special - because we knew we had such good chemistry and we've got such a good group,"" said Richardson, who was named MVP of the regional. ""Everyone would say we were crazy.
If we said this was going to happen, people would call us crazy, but you've just got to believe.
"" No one believes more than their 98-year-old team chaplain, Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt , who led a prayer in the locker room before the game.
Later, she was pushed onto the court in her wheelchair to join the celebration when it was done.
 Sister Jean donned a Final Four cap - she even turned it around backward, just to show she's hip to the kids - and gave a gleeful thumbs-up.
 She's already looking forward to a bigger game next weekend.
 ""I'm going to San Antonio,"" she said. ""That's going to be great.
"" Also joining the celebration were several players from the Ramblers' 1963 national championship team , which played one of the most socially significant games in college basketball history on its way to the title.
It was known as the ""Game of Change,"" matching the Ramblers and their mostly black roster against an all-white Mississippi State team at the height of the civil rights movement, setting up an even more noteworthy contest three years later.
Texas Western, with five African-American starters, defeated Kentucky in the national championship game.
 Les Hunter, a member of that '63 team, said these Ramblers are capable of bringing home another title.
 ""I think they're the best right now,"" Hunter said. ""They work so well together.
They can play with anybody - anybody - right now.
"" Even with a title on its resume, this Loyola performance came out of nowhere.
The Ramblers had not made the tournament since 1985 until they broke the drought by winning the Missouri Valley Conference.
 Then, as if benefiting from some sort of divine intervention, the Ramblers won their first three tournament games by a total of four points .
 Finally, with the Final Four on the line, they turned in a thoroughly dominating performance against the ninth-seeded Wildcats (25-12), the other half of the first 9-vs.
-11 matchup in tournament history.
 Not the least bit intimidated, Loyola came out in attack mode right from the start against a Kansas State team that rode a stifling defense to the regional final.
Moving the ball just as you'd expect from a veteran squad with two seniors and two fourth-year juniors in the starting lineup, the Ramblers kept getting open looks and bolted to a 36-24 lead.
 ""They jumped out to that big lead and it was tough for us to come back,"" said Xavier Sneed, who led Kansas State with 16 points.
""They kept their foot on the gas."" The Ramblers shot 57 percent against a team that is used to shutting opponents down, including 9 of 18 from 3-point range.
 Kansas State hit just 35 percent from the field - 6 of 26 from beyond the arc.
 Early on the second half, Richardson swished a 3-pointer as he was fouled by Kamau Stokes , winding up flat on his back, flashing a huge smile with his arms raised above his head.
He knocked down the free throw to complete the four-point play, stretching the lead to 44-29. Loyola led by as many as 23. ""We're just a bunch of guys that everybody laughed at .
.
.
when we thought we were going to play Division I basketball,"" Clayton Custer said. ""Nobody thought we could do any of this.

"," ATLANTA (AP) -- Porter Moser stood in front of the scarf-clad Loyola cheering section, a bit dazed but beaming from ear to ear.
 ""Are you kidding me!
Are you kidding me!"" the Ramblers coach screamed over and over.
 No kidding.
 Loyola is headed to the Final Four .
 An improbable NCAA Tournament took its craziest turn yet Saturday night, when Ben Richardson scored a career-high 23 points and the 11th-seeded Ramblers romped to a 78-62 victory over Kansas State to cap off a stunning run through the bracket-busting South Regional.
 The Ramblers (32-5) matched the lowest-seeded team ever to reach the Final Four, joining LSU (1986), George Mason (2006) and VCU (2011).
Those other three all lost in the national semifinals.
 Don't bet against Loyola, which emerged from a regional that produced a staggering array of upsets.
The South became the first regional in tournament history to have the top four seeds - including overall No. 1 Virginia - knocked out on the opening weekend.
 In the end, it was the Ramblers cutting down the nets.
 After three close calls, this one was downright easy.
 ""We believed that we could do something like this - do something really special - because we knew we had such good chemistry and we've got such a good group,"" said Richardson, who was named MVP of the regional. ""Everyone would say we were crazy.
If we said this was going to happen, people would call us crazy, but you've just got to believe.
"" No one believes more than their 98-year-old team chaplain, Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt , who led a prayer in the locker room before the game.
When it was done, she was pushed onto the confetti-covered court in her wheelchair to join the celebration.
 Sister Jean donned a Final Four cap - she even turned it around backward, just to show she's hip to the kids - and gave a gleeful thumbs-up.
 She's already looking forward to a bigger game next weekend.
 ""I'm going to San Antonio,"" she said. ""That's going to be great.
"" Also joining the celebration were several players from the Ramblers' 1963 national championship team , which played one of the most socially significant games in college basketball history on its way to the title.
It was known as the ""Game of Change,"" matching the Ramblers and their mostly black roster against an all-white Mississippi State team at the height of the civil rights movement, setting up an even more noteworthy contest three years later when Texas Western, with five African-American starters, defeated Kentucky in the national championship game.
 Les Hunter, a member of that '63 team, said these Ramblers are capable of bringing home another title.
 ""I think they're the best right now,"" Hunter said. ""They work so well together.
They can play with anybody - anybody - right now.
"" Even with a title on its resume, this Loyola performance came out of nowhere.
The Ramblers had not made the tournament since 1985 until they broke the drought by winning the Missouri Valley Conference.
 Then, as if benefiting from some sort of divine intervention, the Ramblers won their first three tournament games by a total of four points .
 Finally, with the Final Four on the line, they turned in a thoroughly dominating performance against the ninth-seeded Wildcats (25-12), the other half of the first 9-vs.
-11 matchup in tournament history.
 Not the least bit intimidated, Loyola came out in attack mode right from the start against a Kansas State team that rode a stifling defense to the regional final.
Moving the ball just as you'd expect from a veteran squad with two seniors and two fourth-year juniors in the starting lineup, the Ramblers kept getting open looks and bolted to a 36-24 halftime lead.
 ""They jumped out to that big lead and it was tough for us to come back,"" said Xavier Sneed, who led Kansas State with 16 points.
""They kept their foot on the gas."" The Ramblers shot 57 percent against a team that is used to shutting opponents down, including 9 of 18 from 3-point range.
 Kansas State hit just 35 percent from the field - 6 of 26 beyond the arc.
 Early on the second half, Richardson swished a 3-pointer as he was fouled by Kamau Stokes , winding up flat on his back, flashing a huge smile with his arms raised above his head.
He knocked down the free throw to complete the four-point play, stretching the lead to 44-29. Loyola led by as many as 23. ""We're just a bunch of guys that everybody laughed at .
.
.
when we thought we were going to play Division I basketball,"" Clayton Custer said. ""Nobody thought we could do any of this.
"" They do now.
 BIG PICTURE Loyola: While Richardson was the top scorer, the Ramblers got contributions from everyone.

40,16170,"['start tweeting', 'Mainstream Media', 'mocked', 'gone CRAZY!', 'early start', 'florida before his late', 'late afternoon']"," WASHINGTON (AP) -- Donald Trump decided to mingle with members of the mainstream media he loves to lash out against, and his presidential debut at Washington's annual Gridiron dinner was certain to invite close watch to see how he handled the expected ribbing.
 The white-tie gala is the kind of establishment event that Trump has shunned since taking office.
But what was supposed to be a good-natured bread-breaking between the president and press could become a flashpoint if Trump, who has labeled reporters ""fake news"" and the ""enemy of the American people,"" proves unable to poke fun at himself or take a lashing from the press.
 ""I think he is in a potentially strange spot where he either attacks the press in a way that works really well at a rally but just gets crickets in that room, or he has spent the past two years calling reporters 'fake news' and then suddenly admits it's just the act,"" said David Litt, a former speechwriter for President Barack Obama who helped write many of Obama's comedy speeches.
 At the dinner, journalists in costume perform song parodies before politicians from both parties give their speeches.
The Gridiron's motto - ""singe, don't burn"" - suggests speakers should feel free to poke and prod, but gingerly.
Every president since Grover Cleveland has been subjected at least once.
 Trump skipped the event last year and sent Vice President Mike Pence instead.
Trump also passed up the White House Correspondents' Association dinner.
It's not known whether he will attend that dinner on April 28;
his Gridiron reception could serve as a test.
 Despite Trump's reputation for being notoriously thin-skinned, Trump has subjected himself to roasts in the past.
 At New York City's Friar's Club in 2004, Regis Philbin and others skewered the New York City real estate developer for his sexual escapades and business failures.
Video of the event shows Trump laughing heartily and delivering a rebuttal that was classic Trump.
 In addition to thanking his wife and mocking Philbin's height, Trump bragged about his success in developing casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and claimed he'd drawn the ""biggest crowd they've ever had.
"" Seven years later, Trump agreed to be pilloried at a 2011 Comedy Central roast that included Snoop Dogg, Seth MacFarlane and Mike ""The Situation"" Sorrentino.
Trump scowled through most of the event, said Ray James, who served as lead writer.
 James said Trump was difficult to work with, handcuffing writers, constantly asking whether things were funny and changing jokes to inflate his wealth.
 ""He didn't get it, he didn't think the jokes were funny,"" said James, adding that Trump also made clear to writers that certain topics were off-limits.
 ""Donald Trump's rule was, 'Don't say I have less money than I say I do,'"" roaster Anthony Jeselnik told Joan Rivers in 2013.
""He was like, 'Make fun of my kids, do whatever you want. Just don't say I don't have that much money.'"" The closest Trump has come in recent years to the Gridiron dynamic was New York's Al Smith dinner during the 2016 campaign, also attended by Trump's Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton.
 Trump began innocently enough.
He joked that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., used to love Trump when he was a Democrat.
He poked fun at a plagiarism incident involving his wife.
 But Trump's remarks soon devolved into bitterness and insults, with the soon-to-be-president earning boos as he accused Clinton of corruption and hating Catholics.
 Jeff Nussbaum, a partner at the speechwriting firm West Wing Writers who has worked with numerous politicians to craft speeches for the event, said Trump's ""insult comic"" style isn't one that's typically been well-received at these kinds of gatherings.
 ""Humor is an incredibly powerful weapon.
But to wield it on others, you need to demonstrate that you can turn it on yourself first.
And that's something President Trump has never demonstrated,"" said Nussbaum.
 Robert Lehrman, a former speechwriter for Al Gore and professor at American University who has written about the use of comedy in politics, pointed to Sarah Palin's 2009 self-deprecating speech at the Gridiron, which included a joke about being able to see the Russian Embassy from her hotel room, as a potential model for Trump.
 Lehrman warned of the potential ramifications of a joke gone bad.
 In a Washington Press Club Foundation dinner in 2004, then-Sen.
Jon Corzine, D-N.J., compared sharing a media market with Schumer to ""sharing a banana with a monkey ... take a little bite of it and he will throw his own feces at you."" The joke infuriated Schumer, souring their relationship.

41,16635,"['New York', 'York City', 'City Council', 'Council members', 'investigation', 'contends initiated', 'initiated by previousprevious landord', 'Kushner Cos']"," NEW YORK (AP) -- When the Kushner Cos.
bought three apartment buildings in a gentrifying neighborhood of Queens in 2015, most of the tenants were protected by special rules that prevent developers from pushing them out, raising rents and turning a tidy profit.
 But that's exactly what the company then run by Jared Kushner did, and with remarkable speed.
Two years later, it sold all three buildings for $60 million, nearly 50 percent more than it paid.
 Now a clue has emerged as to how President Donald Trump's son-in-law's firm was able to move so fast: The Kushner Cos.
routinely filed false paperwork with the city declaring it had zero rent-regulated tenants in dozens of buildings it owned across the city when, in fact, it had hundreds.
 While none of the documents during a three-year period when Kushner was CEO bore his personal signature, they provide a window into the ethics of the business empire he ran before he went on to become one of the most trusted advisers to the president of the United States.
 ""It's bare-faced greed,"" said Aaron Carr, founder of Housing Rights Initiative, a tenants' rights watchdog that compiled the work permit application documents and shared them with The Associated Press.
""The fact that the company was falsifying all these applications with the government shows a sordid attempt to avert accountability and get a rapid return on its investment."" Kushner Cos.
responded in a statement that it outsources the preparation of such documents to third parties that are reviewed by independent counsel, and ""if mistakes or violations are identified, corrective action is taken immediately."" ""Kushner would never deny any tenant their due-process rights,"" it said, adding that the company ""has renovated thousands of apartments and developments with minimal complaints over the past 30 years.
"" For the three Queens buildings in the borough's Astoria neighborhood, the Kushner Cos.
checked a box on construction permit applications in 2015 that indicated the buildings had zero rent-regulated tenants.
Tax records filed a few months later showed the company inherited as many as 94 rent-regulated units from the previous owner.
 In all, Housing Rights Initiative found the Kushner Cos.
filed at least 80 false applications for construction permits in 34 buildings across New York City from 2013 to 2016, all of them indicating there were no rent-regulated tenants.
Instead, tax documents show there were more than 300 rent-regulated units.
Nearly all the permit applications were signed by a Kushner employee, including sometimes the chief operating officer.
 Had the Kushner Cos.
disclosed those rent-regulated tenants, it could have triggered stricter oversight of construction crews by the city, including possibly unscheduled ""sweeps"" on site by inspectors to keep the company from harassing tenants and getting them to leave.
 Instead, current and former tenants of the Queens buildings told the AP that they were subjected to extensive construction, with banging, drilling, dust and leaking water that they believe were part of targeted harassment to get them to leave and clear the way for higher-paying renters.
 ""It was noisy, there were complaints, I got mice,"" said mailman Rudolph Romano, adding that the Kushner Cos.
tried to increase his rent by 60 percent, an accusation the company denied.
""They cleaned the place out. I watched the whole building leave."" Tax records show those rent-regulated units that numbered as many as 94 when Kushner took over fell to 25 by 2016. In Kushner buildings across the city, records show frequent complaints about construction going on early in the morning or late at night against the rules, improper or illegal construction, and work without a permit.
 At a six-story walk-up in Manhattan's East Village that was once home to the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, the Kushner Cos.
filed an application to begin construction in late 2013 that, again, listed zero rent-regulated tenants.
Tax records a few months later showed seven rent-regulated units.
 ""All of a sudden, there was drilling, drilling.
...
You heard the drilling in the middle of night,"" said one of the rent-regulated tenants, Mary Ann Siwek, 67, who lives on Social Security payments and odd jobs.
""There were rats coming in from the abandoned building next door. The hallways were always filled with lumber and sawdust and plaster."" A knock on the door came a few weeks later, and an offer of at least $10,000 if she agreed to leave the building.
 ""I know it's pretty horrible, but we can help you get out,"" Siwek recalls the man saying. ""We can offer you money.
"" Siwek turned down the cash and sued instead.
She said she won a year's worth of free rent and a new refrigerator.
 New York City Council member Ritchie Torres, who plans to launch an investigation into permit applications, said: ""The Kushners appear to be engaging in what I call the weaponization of construction."" Rent stabilization is a fixture of New York City that can bedevil developers seeking to make money off buildings.
To free themselves of its restrictions, landlords usually have to wait until the rent rises above $2,733 a month, something that can take years given the small increases allowed each year.
 Submitting false documents to the city's Department of Buildings for construction permits is a misdemeanor, which can carry fines of up to $25,000.
But real estate experts say it is often flouted with little to no consequences.
Landlords who do so get off with no more than a demand from the city, sometimes a year or more later, to file an ""amended"" form with the correct numbers.
 Housing Rights Initiative found the Kushner Cos.
filed dozens of amended forms for the buildings mentioned in the documents, most of them a year to two later.
 ""There is a lack of tools to go after landlords who harass tenants, and there is a lack of enforcement,"" said Seth Miller, a real estate lawyer who used to work at a state housing agency overseeing rent regulations.
Until officials inspect every construction site, ""you're going to have this incentive for landlords to make life uncomfortable for tenants.
"" New York City's Department of Buildings declined to comment specifically on the false application documents but said it is ramping up its monitoring of construction, hiring 72 new inspectors and other staff under city laws recently passed to crack down on tenant harassment.
 ""We won't tolerate landlords who use construction to harass tenants - no matter who they are,"" said spokesman Joseph Soldevere.
He added that two of the Queens buildings are under investigation by a tenant-harassment task force.
 Exactly how much money the Kushner Cos.
earned from the buildings mentioned in the documents is unclear.
Of those 34 buildings, only the three in Queens and a fourth in Brooklyn appear to have been sold.
The company also likely made money by reducing the number of rent-regulated tenants and bringing in those who would pay more.
 Jared Kushner, who stepped down as CEO of the Kushner Cos.
last year before taking on his advisory role at the White House, sold off part of his real estate holdings as required under government ethics rules.
But he retained stakes in many properties, including Westminster Management, the Kushner Cos.
subsidiary that oversees its residential properties.
A financial disclosure last year showed he still owns a stake in Westminster and earned $1.6 million from the holding.
 Back in Queens, the mailman Romano was one of the few rent-regulated tenants who fought back.
 He hired a lawyer who found out he was protected from the 60 percent rent hike by law, something Romano did not know at the time.
And he said his rent, which was set to increase to $3,750, was restored to $2,350. Romano is still in the building where he has lived for nine years, with his wife, four children and his guests from the construction days - the mice.

42,17982,"['allegiance', 'loyalty', 'israeli', 'iranian', 'Israel', 'iran']"," BEIRUT (AP) -- Few countries are as vulnerable to the Middle East's mayhem as Lebanon, which has taken in a million refugees from the catastrophic war in neighboring Syria, seen the Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah militia embroiled in that war and watched Saudi Arabia try to oust its prime minister.
 Yet campaigning for Sunday's parliamentary election, the first in nine years, has timidly sidestepped the big issues, leaving many Lebanese expecting more of the same.
It's especially galling for Lebanese concerned a still-dominant Hezbollah could drag the country into a looming Iranian-Israeli regional confrontation.
 The vote is expected to be a test for the country's Western-backed Sunni prime minister, Saad Hariri, and his Iran-backed Shiite militant opponent, Hezbollah, which is looking to tighten its grip and expand its presence in the 128-seat parliament - likely at Hariri's expense.
 Interior Minister Nouhad Mashnouk, a member of Hariri's inner circle, said the election is not ""a Sunni-Shiite conflict but rather a conflict between a group that believes in a state and a nation, and another that has regional and Iranian leanings.
"" The sides, however, can hardly govern effectively without each other and are expected to recreate the unity government that currently exists, which incorporates members of the militant group.
 Most of the campaigning by more than 500 candidates has revolved around platforms of stability and economic growth, with many of Lebanon's civil war-era political titans set to return, including Lebanon's aging Shiite parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally who has held the post for more than 25 years and who is virtually uncontested.
Some warlords are passing on their seats to their sons, including Druze leader Walid Jumblatt.
 ""Divisive issues such as Hezbollah's weapons and the controversy over its participation in regional conflicts are almost entirely absent from the electoral campaigns, indicating implicit acceptance of the party's domestic hegemony,"" wrote analyst Joseph Bahout in an article for the Carnegie Middle East Center.
 A new election law agreed on last year has opened cracks through which rivals within the Shiite community could potentially challenge Hezbollah, and political newcomers and independents could try to break through the monopoly long enjoyed by the political dynasties.
 It also promises to shake things up by reorganizing Lebanon's electoral map, consolidating 23 districts into 15, and awarding seats by share of the vote received, rather than winner-takes-all.
The law also allows Lebanese expatriates to vote abroad for the first time, adding a new level of unpredictability to the mix.
 The last time elections were held in Lebanon was in 2009.
Since then, members of parliament have extended their terms twice, citing security threats linked to the war in neighboring Syria.
 Lebanon is technically a parliamentary democracy but is shackled by a decades-old sectarian-based power-sharing system, and its politics are dominated by former warlords that have long exploited the system to perpetuate corruption and nepotism.
All senior government positions are allocated according to sect, including the head of state, who should be a Christian, the prime minister, a Sunni Muslim, and the parliament speaker, a Shiite.
Parliament is divided equally between Christians and Muslims, with seats allotted according to religious sect.
 The formula, based on outdated demographic data that does not account for nearly 200,000 Palestinians who are denied citizenship and a vote, allows people to vote according to their religious affiliations, not a political program.
 A record number of first-time hopefuls are campaigning for change, urging voters to shun politicians who have drowned the country in corruption and debt.
Many rose to prominence as organizers of protests over a 2015 trash collection crisis that left garbage in the streets for months and laid bare the extent of the public sector mismanagement plaguing Lebanon.
 ""It reflects a new mindset emerging among significant sectors of the Lebanese electorate, pointing in the direction of making a small dent in the religious sect-based political system,"" said Randa Slim, an analyst with the Washington-based Middle East Institute.
 Still, the biggest winner appears to be Hezbollah and its allies, who look set to scoop up at least some of the seats lost by Hariri's coalition, largely because of the expected fragmentation of the Sunni vote.
 Hariri now has the largest block in parliament, but is likely to lose seats to rival politicians.
Some of Hariri's supporters shifted their loyalty after the billionaire businessman, who also holds Saudi citizenship, laid off scores of employees in his development company, Saudi Oger, as well as in Hariri-owned charities and media outlets in Lebanon, largely because of Saudi spending cuts.
 That loss of support has been compounded by what some see as a weak stance vis-a-vis Hezbollah, accusing him of catering to and giving political cover to the militant group, which a U.N.-backed tribunal has accused in the 2015 assassination of his father, Rafik Hariri.
 Hezbollah offered its support to Hariri after he was detained in Saudi Arabia late last year during a visit to Riyadh in which he announced his resignation as prime minister, citing Iran and Hezbollah's meddling in the region.
The move was widely seen as Saudi coercion, although Hariri denies stepping down against his will and has since reversed his resignation.
 Hezbollah now seeks, along with its allies, to win at least 43 seats in the 128-member legislature, which would enable the militant group to veto any laws it opposes.
 Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria to shore up President Bashar Assad, and has cleared the vast region along the countries' shared border of Islamic militants, leaving hundreds of its fighters killed and wounded.
It is now campaigning heavily on those achievements.
 Its leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, called for heavy voter turnout, particularly in the Baalbek-Hermel region in eastern Lebanon, traditionally a Hezbollah stronghold which now faces a challenge from rivals.
 ""You should protect with your votes your victories and achievements, for which you've paid a very high price,"" Nasrallah said in an appeal to supporters at an election rally in the area on Monday.
 Despite limited pushback from the Shiite community, Hezbollah has largely delivered on its promises in Syria as far as the Shiite community is concerned and will now be expected to deliver on the economic front, Slim said.
 She expects a governing coalition between Hariri and Hezbollah to re-emerge from Sunday's vote and says if the elections produce a weaker Hariri, it will be all the more reason for Hezbollah to push for him to be the next prime minister.
 ""In light of the talk of a looming Iranian-Israeli confrontation in Syria, Hezbollah will be more incentivized in not rocking the boat in Lebanon,"" she said.

"," BEIRUT (AP) -- Few countries are as vulnerable to the Middle East's mayhem as Lebanon, which has taken in a million refugees from the catastrophic war in neighboring Syria, seen the Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah militia embroiled in that war and watched Saudi Arabia try to oust its prime minister.

The lawmakers' personal stories have lent weight to the effort to combat what public health officials have deemed a full-blown epidemic that is fast approaching the severity of the AIDS outbreak of the 1980s and '90s.
 More than 52,000 people died of a drug overdose in 2015, and roughly two-thirds of them had used prescription opioids like OxyContin or Vicodin or illegal drugs like heroin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Those overdoses have jumped 33 percent in the past five years alone, with some states reporting the death toll had doubled or more.

All the lights were off, except for the glow of a bathroom light.
That's where Marina Krim found her two children - covered in blood, slaughtered by the family's trusted nanny.
 ""It's like a horror movie,"" she said Thursday, testifying in the murder trial of the caretaker, Yoselyn Ortega. ""I go down, I walk down the hall and I see the light on under the back of the door, and I'm like, 'Oh God it's so quiet in here, oh God. Why is it so ... quiet?'"" ""And I open the door ...
And I open the door, oh God!"" she wept.
 Krim was the first witness at Ortega's trial.
Prosecutors said the nanny planned the Oct. 25, 2012, killing, waiting until she was alone in the apartment, selected two knives from the kitchen and then killed 2-year-old Leo and 6-year-old Lucia, who went by Lulu.
 Krim was at a swimming class with their then 3-year-old daughter, Nessie.
She ran outside with Nessie and called for help after finding her kids, and then started screaming.
 ""It was a scream you can't imagine is even inside of you,"" she said. ""I don't even know where it came from.
I just thought: I'm never going to be able to talk to them ever again.
They are dead.
I just saw my kids dead.
'"" The central mystery of the trial isn't whether Ortega killed the children, but why she did it - and whether she was too mentally ill to be held responsible.

 ""And I look next to her and I see Leo, and he has blood on him .
.
.
blood all over Lulu's little dress .
.
.
"" Krim said.
 Before she took the stand, Krim turned on the courtroom floor and angrily faced Ortega, who showed no emotion.
Krim said she wanted to get a good look at the woman.
 The jurors sat quietly as Krim struggled to explain the deaths through tears.
 As she left the silent courtroom, Krim yelled to Ortega: ""You're gross.
You're disgusting.
"" The only time Ortega appeared to show any emotion was when she shook her head during Krim's testimony on using Ortega as a housekeeper as well as a caregiver.
Ortega leaned toward her attorney as Krim talked about it, shaking her head and saying ""No."" Prosecutors said Lucia had fought back and was slashed and stabbed about 30 times.
Leo suffered five wounds.
Their throats were cut so severely it appeared at first they'd been decapitated, Groves said.
 ""There was no way to save them,"" Groves said.
""The devastation the defendant had inflicted on their little bodies was too much."" Ortega's lawyer said the slayings were an act of madness, but prosecutors argued Ortega said she knew exactly what she was doing.
 ""She knows that killing them was wrong,"" Assistant District Attorney Courtney Groves said.
 But prosecutors conceded there isn't a clear motive.
 Groves said it's possible Ortega's resentment and jealousy of Marina Krim, coupled with an inability to provide for her own son, sent her into a calculated rage.
 ""You may believe you have not heard a satisfactory answer, because there just isn't a satisfactory answer,"" Groves said. ""But not knowing why the defendant slaughtered Lucia and Leo Krim does not mean that she is not responsible for those actions or for those murders.
It merely means there is no good answer.
"" Ortega had worked for about two years for the Krims, who lived in one of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods, a block from Central Park.
By some measures, she had a close relationship with her employers.
 Krim testified that she bought her a plane ticket home to the Dominican Republic for Christmas.
Another time the family went to the island with Ortega to meet her family, and so her bilingual children could practice Spanish.
 Defense attorney Valerie Van Leer-Greenberg said Ortega suffered from severe, undiagnosed mental illness that was not taken seriously in her home country.
She said she heard voices, saw visions and that sometimes the voices commanded her to act.
 But she was ""guarded in her symptoms, reluctant to seek care,"" Van Leer-Greenberg said.
 ""I will ask you to determine at the end of this case whether or not these acts were driven by my client's acute psychotic state,"" she told jurors.
 Prosecutors said Ortega gave police interviews that paint a picture of an unhappy employee: She told authorities that she hurt the children because she was having money problems and was angry at the parents.
She also said her schedule constantly shifted and that she had to act as a cleaning lady though she didn't want to, prosecutors said.
 Marina Krim's husband, Kevin, is a former CNBC executive now at a startup.
They use a Facebook page to post updates on how they are doing, writing about the arrival of two new children, Felix born in 2013 and Linus in 2016. The couple started the Lulu and Leo Fund, which aims to support innovative art programs for children.
They recently posted a video message on Facebook asking that people mention the fund as their case becomes news again.

Another time the family went to the island with Ortega to meet her family, and so her bilingual children could practice Spanish.
 Defense attorney Valerie Van Leer-Greenberg said Ortega suffered from severe, undiagnosed mental illness that was not taken seriously in her home country.
She said she heard voices, saw visions and that sometimes the voices commanded her to act.
 But she was ""guarded in her symptoms, reluctant to seek care,"" Van Leer-Greenberg said.
 ""I will ask you to determine at the end of this case whether or not these acts were driven by my client's acute psychotic state,"" she told jurors.
 But Krim testified Thursday she saw no signs of severe mental distress, and Ortega's family never came to her with any concerns.
""Never!"" she yelled angrily into the microphone.
 Prosecutors said Ortega gave police interviews that paint a picture of an unhappy employee: She told authorities that she hurt the children because she was having money problems and was angry at the parents.
She also said her schedule constantly shifted and that she had to act as a cleaning lady though she didn't want to, prosecutors said.
 Marina Krim's husband, Kevin, is a former CNBC executive now at a startup.
They use a Facebook page to post updates on how they are doing, writing about the arrival of two new children, Felix born in 2013 and Linus in 2016. The couple started the Lulu and Leo Fund, which aims to support innovative art programs for children.
They recently posted a video message on Facebook asking that people mention the fund as their case becomes news again.

46,17313,"['state transport', 'transport taxes', 'new york', 'york city', 'city yellow', 'yellow cab', 'attorneyclient privilege', 'fbi agents', 'Taxi King', 'medallions', '$5 million']"," WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal agents who raided the office of President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, were looking for information about payments to a former Playboy playmate and a porn actress who claim to have had affairs with Trump, two people familiar with the investigation said.
 Public corruption prosecutors in the U.S.
Attorney's office in Manhattan are trying to determine if there was any fraud related to the payments to Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels, according to one of the people.
McDougal, a former playmate, was paid $150,000 by the parent company of the National Enquirer for her story, though the magazine never published it.
Cohen paid $130,000 to Daniels as part of an agreement, made before the 2016 election, to keep her from going public with her allegations.
 A warrant used in the raid Monday specifically authorized agents to seize records related to McDougal, said one of the people, who demanded anonymity to discuss the confidential details.
 The payments appear to be part of a pattern of Trump' self-described fixer trying to shield the businessman-turned-politician from embarrassing press by buying women's silence.
 The new details on the Cohen raid, first reported by The New York Times, emerged as the president boiled over on Twitter about it and evidence that investigators are zeroing in on his inner circle.
The raid on Cohen was not carried out by special counsel Robert Mueller's team.
 But the president's ire has been directed at Mueller and his boss, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
On Monday, Trump called Mueller's investigation ""an attack on our country"" and suggested he was considering firing the special counsel.
 The White House remained defiant that the president has the power to directly fire Mueller - despite Justice Department regulations saying otherwise.
The regulations say only Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller last May, has the authority to fire him and only for specific cause.
Rosenstein has repeatedly said that he has not seen any reason to dismiss Mueller.
 White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday that Trump ""certainly believes he has the power"" to fire Mueller, though he isn't taking that step now.
She echoed Trump's frustration, saying he believes federal authorities have ""gone too far"" by seizing communication between a lawyer and his clients.
 The furious president himself blasted out his displeasure early Tuesday, saying on Twitter: ""Attorney-client privilege is dead!"" In fact, attorney-client privilege is not absolute and can't be invoked when the discussion was part of an effort to commit a crime.
The search was authorized by a judge and no evidence suggests it was carried out improperly.
 The search did not appear related to allegations of Russian election interference or possible coordination with the Trump campaign, the main focus of Mueller's probe.
But the raid was prompted, at least in part, by evidence or allegations uncovered by Mueller's team.
 Under Justice Department regulations, Mueller must consult with Rosenstein when his investigators uncover new evidence that may fall outside his original mandate.
Rosenstein then determines whether to allow Mueller to proceed or to assign the matter to another U.S. attorney or another part of the Justice Department.
 FBI agents searched Cohen's office, apartment and a hotel room where he's been staying while his home is under renovation, looking for documents related to Daniels and McDougal.
 McDougal has said she carried on an affair with Trump in 2006 after the birth of his son.
The Enquirer's publisher, American Media Inc., said they paid McDougal for details of the alleged affair, but they never appeared in print.
AMI has said she was paid to become a fitness columnist.
 Cohen's attorney, Stephen Ryan, did not respond to questions about McDougal on Tuesday.
 Agents also seized records related to a $130,000 payment made to Daniels, who says she had sex with Trump the same year as McDougal.
Daniels' team has had extensive communications with federal investigators, said a third person familiar with the investigations, who demanded anonymity to discuss the confidential matter.
 Cohen has said he paid Daniels out of his own pocket shortly before the 2016 presidential election, but has not explained why.
 Several former officials at the Federal Election Commission have said the payment could have violated campaign finance laws, because it may amount to an unreported campaign donation.
 Cohen has said neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was involved in the transaction with Daniels and he was not reimbursed for the payment.
Trump has said he didn't know about the payment.
The White House has consistently said Trump denies the affair.
 In his first public comments since the raid, Cohen told CNN on Tuesday that he is rethinking how he handled the payment to Daniels because of what it's done to his family.
He also praised the FBI agents who carried out the search as ""professional, courteous and respectful."" Asked if he was worried, Cohen told CNN: ""I would be lying to you if I told that I am not.
Do I need this in my life?
No.
Do I want to be involved in this?
No.

"" Cohen has been involved in the New York City yellow cab industry since the 1990s, going into business with his Ukraine-born father-in-law.
 Some of his companies that owned medallions were given names such as NY Funky Taxi Corp, Mad Dog Cab Corp and Sir Michael Hacking Corp.
 Although he has said publicly that he got out of the business in the mid-2000s, city, state and court records show he and his wife own as many as 30 medallions.
 Tax records show some of his companies currently owe thousands of dollars in mandatory per-ride state transportation taxes.
 In recent years, his taxis were managed by Gene Freidman, the so-called Taxi King of New York and a close friend.
Freidman was charged last year by state prosecutors with pocketing $5 million in state transportation taxes.
He's pleaded not guilty.

47,16687,"['Trump son-in-law', 'son-in-law Jared', 'Jared Kushner', 'White house', 'envoy', 'Jared Greenblatt', 'Mideast peace', 'peace plan', ' Crown Prince', 'Middle East']"," WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saudi Arabia's young crown prince has an ambitious list of to-dos: modernize his conservative kingdom, weaken Iran's hand across the Mideast and, this week, rehabilitate his country's image in the eyes of Americans.
 Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, son of King Salman and heir to the throne, is opening a marathon tour of the United States with a stop in Washington, where he plans to meet President Donald Trump on Tuesday.
He'll hold separate meetings with a long roster of influential U.S. officials, including the secretaries of defense, treasury and commerce, the CIA chief and congressional leaders from both parties.
 The visit comes as the United States and much of the West are still trying to figure out Crown Prince Mohammed, better known by his initials MBS, whose sweeping program of social changes at home and increased Saudi assertiveness abroad has upended decades of traditional rule in Saudi Arabia.
The 32-year-old crown prince also has big economic plans, and over three weeks in the U.S. he will meet businessmen in New York, tech mavens from Google and Apple Inc. in San Francisco, and entertainment bigwigs in Los Angeles.
Other stops include Boston and Houston.
 ""This is not the real Saudi Arabia,"" MBS said when asked by CBS News about the repressive version of Islam many outsiders associate with the kingdom.
He said he was restoring the more tolerant, egalitarian society that existed before Saudi Arabia's ultraconservatives were empowered in 1979.
""We were victims, especially my generation that suffered from this a great deal."" It's a message that has earned MBS admirers in the United States, as he allowed women to drive and opened movie theaters shuttered since the 1980s.
MBS is turning ""Saudi Arabia into a normal country in which normal people lead normal lives,"" Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told reporters Monday.
 Yet Democrats and Republicans have approached some of the crown prince's other bold steps with trepidation, particularly as they pertain to his anti-Iran efforts.
One bill in Congress proposes scaling back U.S. military assistance to a Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen.
 MBS, in particular, has been closely identified with the three-year-old war in the Arab world's poorest country, which started while he was defense minister.
The Saudis and their allies are fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels, but international organizations have harshly criticized the coalition's airstrikes and blockading of Yemeni ports for contributing to thousands of civilian deaths and a humanitarian catastrophe.
 It's not the only regional mess the Saudis are in.
In November, U.S. officials voiced unease when Lebanon's prime minister unexpectedly resigned while in Riyadh.
Saudi Arabia was accused of attempting to bring down Lebanon's government, which is strongly influenced by Iranian proxy Hezbollah.
Prime Minister Saad Hariri later reversed his resignation.
 The Saudis are working aggressively to change perceptions.
They've cast themselves as essential partners against Islamist extremist groups and, especially since Trump's maiden overseas voyage last year, touted their lavish purchases of high-tech goods from job-creating American companies.
In Yemen, the kingdom says it is improving military targeting, opening up ports and pledging $1.5 billion in new aid.
 ""The concerns expressed there are reflective of deep concerns by the American public at large,"" said Lori Plotkin Boghardt, a Gulf scholar at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
""The Saudis are very sensitive to this.
They're certainly communicating with elite circles to discuss the measures they're taking to try to get humanitarian assistance in to Yemen.
"" In MBS, Trump will find a sympathetic ear for his calls to crack down on Iran, Saudi Arabia's archenemy, and strengthen a 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran that former President Barack Obama and world powers brokered.
Trump has threatened to pull out of the agreement unless there are changes by May.
Last week, Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, an advocate of staying in the accord, choosing Mike Pompeo, the current CIA director and nuclear deal critic, as a replacement.
 MBS could dangle a huge carrot in front of Trump for his support.
Stock exchanges in New York and elsewhere are vying for the international listing of Aramco, the Saudi oil behemoth expected to go public soon.
Saudi concerns with New York include a post-9/11 law that could jeopardize assets in the United States if victims' families claim Saudi Arabia helped the al-Qaida attackers and sue for compensation.
 Although the U.S. has welcomed MBS's determination to purge pervasive corruption in Saudi Arabia, including by royals, the Trump administration hasn't endorsed his tactics.
Last year, more than 150 high-level princes, ministers, military officials and businessmen were abruptly rounded up and detained at the Ritz-Carlton hotel.
They eventually paid settlements that Saudi Arabia says exceeded $106 billion.
 Al-Jubeir, the foreign minister, said the tough tactics were needed after past anti-corruption campaigns failed.
 ""It didn't work,"" he said. ""So now you do something dramatic.

(AP) -- Authorities in California plan to make a ""major announcement"" in the case of an elusive serial killer they say committed at least 12 homicides, 45 rapes and dozens of burglaries across the state in the 1970s and 1980s.
 Jane Carson-Sandler, who was sexually assaulted in California in 1976 by a man believed to be the so-called ""East Area Rapist,"" said she received an email Wednesday from a retired detective who worked on the case telling her they have identified the rapist and he's in custody.
 ""I have just been overjoyed, ecstatic.
It's an emotional roller-coaster right now,"" Carson-Sandler, who now lives near Hilton Head, South Carolina, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
""I feel like I'm in the middle of a dream and I'm going to wake up and it's not going to be true.
It's just so nice to have closure and to know he's in jail.
"" Armed with a gun, the masked attacker terrorized communities by breaking into homes while single women or couples were sleeping.
He sometimes tied up the man and piled dishes on his back, then raped the woman while threatening to kill them both if the dishes tumbled.
 He often took souvenirs, notably coins and jewelry, from his victims, who ranged in age from 13 to 41 Carson-Sandle was attacked in her home in the Sacramento suburb of Citrus Heights.
A home in that community belonging to a former police officer was being searched Wednesday by FBI investigators and police from several agencies.
 Two neighbors who declined to give their names said authorities arrived at the scene before midnight.
Sacramento County Jail records show the man who lives at the home was booked into the facility at 2:30 a.m. on suspicion of murder.
 Sacramento County district attorney's spokeswoman Shelly Orio declined to comment other than to say a news conference will be held Wednesday afternoon in Sacramento to make ""a major announcement"" about the case.
 FBI and California officials in 2016 renewed their search for the attacker dubbed the East Area Rapist and announced a $50,000 reward for his arrest and conviction.
He's linked to more than 175 crimes in all between 1976 and 1986. As he committed crimes across the state, authorities called him by different names.
He was dubbed the East Area Rapist after his start in Northern California, the Original Night Stalker after a series of Southern California slayings, and the Diamond Knot Killer for using an elaborate binding method on two of his victims.
 Most recently called the Golden State Killer, he has been linked through DNA and other evidence to scores of crimes.
 Authorities decided to publicize the case again in 2016 in advance of the 40th anniversary of his first known assault in Sacramento County.

"," SACRAMENTO, Calif.
(AP) -- A DNA match led to the arrest of a 72-year-old former police officer in one of the most baffling and sadistic crime sprees of the 1970s and '80s - a string of at least 12 slayings and 45 rapes in California by an attacker dubbed the Golden State Killer, police said Wednesday.
 Armed with a gun, the masked attacker would break into homes while single women or couples were sleeping.
He sometimes tied up the man and piled dishes on his back, then raped the woman while threatening to kill them both if the dishes tumbled.
He often took souvenirs, notably coins and jewelry, from his victims, who ranged in age from 13 to 41. The match led to Joseph James DeAngelo, who was fired in 1979 from the police department in Auburn, northeast of Sacramento.
Despite an outpouring of thousands of tips over the years, his name had not been on authorities' radar before last week, District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert said.
 ""We knew we were looking for a needle in a haystack, but we also knew that needle was there,"" Schubert said.
""We found the needle in the haystack, and it was right here in Sacramento."" ""The answer was always going to be in the DNA,"" she said.
 Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones referred to the genetic material as ""discarded DNA,"" but authorities refused to give specifics about how it was collected or matched to the suspect.
 DeAngelo was arrested on suspicion of committing four killings in Sacramento and Ventura counties, authorities said.
 ""Very possibly he was committing the crimes when he was employed as a peace officer,"" Jones said.
 The suspect was fired from the Auburn department in 1979 after he was arrested for stealing a can of dog repellant and a hammer from a drug store, according to Auburn Journal articles from the time.
 FBI agents were gathering evidence at a Sacramento-area home linked to DeAngelo, the agency said.
 As the crimes unfolded across the state, authorities called the attacker by different names.
He was dubbed the East Area Rapist after his start in Northern California, the Original Night Stalker after a series of Southern California slayings and the Diamond Knot Killer for using an elaborate binding method on two of his victims.
 He was most recently called the Golden State Killer.

 DeAngelo, who was also a police officer in Exeter, in Southern California, from 1973 to 1976, was taken into custody without incident as officers surprised him at his Sacramento-area home, Jones said.
 ""This was a truly a convergence of emerging technology and dogged determination by detectives,"" Jones added.
 Neighbors knew DeAngelo as a man who whose angry, curse-filled outbursts would carry through the neighborhood if he couldn't find his keys or something else set him off.
 ""He liked the F word a lot,"" neighbor Natalia Bedes-Correnti said.
 He never yelled at people, she said, just lashed out when he'd get frustrated.
 ""He'd be out on his driveway yelling and screaming, looking for his keys,"" she said. ""I could hear him from inside my house yelling and screaming.
He was very loud.
"" But he hadn't had an outburst in several years, she said, and she assumed he was mellowing in old age or receiving professional help.
 Kevin Tapia, now 36, said when he was a teenager, DeAngelo falsely accused him of throwing things over their shared fence, prompting a heated exchange between DeAngelo and Tapia's father.
He said DeAngelo could often be heard cursing in frustration in his backyard.
 ""No one thinks they live next door to a serial killer,"" Tapia said.
""But at the same time I'm just like, he was a weird guy.
He kept to himself.
When you start to think about it you're like, I could see him doing something like that, but I would never suspect it.

49,16726,"['major breach', 'cnn interview', 'SCL Group', 'David Carroll', 'sued Cambridge', 'facebook post', 'facebook officals']"," NEW YORK (AP) -- Breaking more than four days of silence, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted mistakes and outlined steps to protect user data in light of a privacy scandal involving a Trump-connected data-mining firm.
 Zuckerberg said Wednesday that Facebook has a ""responsibility"" to protect its users' data and if it fails, ""we don't deserve to serve you.
"" But Zuckerberg stopped short of apologizing.
 And he wrote ""what happened"" instead of ""what we did,"" leaving Facebook one step removed from responsibility.
 Richard Levick, chairman of the crisis-management firm Levick, gave Zuckerberg's response a ""B-"" grade, in part because how late it came.
 Zuckerberg and Facebook's No. 2 executive, Sheryl Sandberg, had been quiet since news broke Friday that Cambridge Analytica may have used data improperly obtained from roughly 50 million Facebook users to try to sway elections.
Cambridge's clients included Donald Trump's general-election campaign.
 Facebook shares have dropped some 8 percent, lopping about $46 billion off the company's market value, since the revelations were first published.
 Even before the scandal broke, Facebook has already taken the most important steps to prevent a recurrence, Zuckerberg said.
For example, in 2014, it reduced access outside apps had to user data.
However, some of the measures didn't take effect until a year later, allowing Cambridge to access the data in the intervening months.
 Zuckerberg acknowledges that there is more to do.
 In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Zuckerberg said it will ban developers who don't agree to an audit.
An app's developer will no longer have access to data from people who haven't used that app in three months.
Data will also be generally limited to user names, profile photos and email, unless the developer signs a contract with Facebook and gets user approval.
 In a separate post, Facebook said it will inform people whose data was misused by apps.
And in the future, when it bans an app for misusing people's data, Facebook promises to tell everyone who used it.
 Facebook first learned of this breach of privacy more than two years ago, but hadn't mentioned it publicly until Friday.
 The company said it was ""building a way"" for people to know if their data was accessed by ""This Is Your Digital Life,"" the psychological-profiling quiz app that researcher Aleksandr Kogan created and paid about 270,000 people to take part in.
Cambridge Analytica later obtained data from the app for about 50 million Facebook users, as the app also vacuumed up data on people's friends - those who never downloaded the app or gave explicit consent.
 Chris Wylie, a Cambridge co-founder who left in 2014, has said one of the firm's goals was to influence people's perceptions by injecting content, some misleading or false, all around them.
It's not clear whether Facebook would be able to tell users whether they had seen such content.
 Cambridge has shifted the blame to Kogan, which the firm described as a contractor.
Kogan described himself as a scapegoat.
 Kogan, a psychology researcher at Cambridge University, told the BBC that both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have tried to place the blame on him for violating the social media platform's terms of service, even though Cambridge Analytica ensured him that everything he did was legal.
 Kogan said Cambridge Analytica approached him to gather Facebook data and provided the legal advice that this was ""appropriate."" ""One of the great mistakes I did here was I just didn't ask enough questions,"" he said. ""I had never done a commercial project;
I didn't really have any reason to doubt their sincerity.

 Sandy Parakilas, who worked in data protection for Facebook in 2011 and 2012, told a U.K. parliamentary committee Wednesday that the company was vigilant about its network security but lax when it came to protecting users' data.
 He said personal data including email addresses and in some cases private messages was allowed to leave Facebook servers with no real controls on how the data was used after that.
 ""The real challenge here is that Facebook was allowing developers to access the data of people who hadn't explicitly authorized that,"" he said, adding that the company had ""lost sight"" of what developers did with the data.

"," NEW YORK (AP) -- Breaking five days of silence, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized for a ""major breach of trust,"" admitted mistakes and outlined steps to protect user data in light of a privacy scandal involving a Trump-connected data-mining firm.
 ""I am really sorry that happened,"" Zuckerberg said of the scandal involving data mining firm Cambridge Analytica.
Facebook has a ""responsibility"" to protect its users' data, he said in a Wednesday interview on CNN.
If it fails, he said, ""we don't deserve to have the opportunity to serve people.
"" His mea culpa on cable television came a few hours after he acknowledged his company's mistakes in a Facebook post , but without saying he was sorry.
 Zuckerberg and Facebook's No. 2 executive, Sheryl Sandberg, had been quiet since news broke Friday that Cambridge may have used data improperly obtained from roughly 50 million Facebook users to try to sway elections.
Cambridge's clients included Donald Trump's general-election campaign.
 Facebook shares have dropped some 8 percent, lopping about $46 billion off the company's market value, since the revelations were first published.
 In the CNN interview, Zuckerberg offered equivocal and carefully hedged answers to two other questions.
He said, for instance, that he would be ""happy"" to testify before Congress, but only if it was ""the right thing to do."" He went on to note that many other Facebook officials might be more appropriate witnesses depending on what Congress wanted to know.
 Similarly, the Facebook chief seemed at one point to favor regulation for Facebook and other internet giants - at least the ""right"" kind of rules, he said, such as ones that require online political ads to disclose who paid for them.
In almost the next breath, however, Zuckerberg steered clear of endorsing a bill that would write such rules into federal law, and instead talked up Facebook's own voluntary efforts on that front.
 Even before the scandal broke, Facebook has already taken the most important steps to prevent a recurrence, Zuckerberg said.
For example, in 2014, it reduced access outside apps had to user data.
However, some of the measures didn't take effect until a year later, allowing Cambridge to access the data in the intervening months.
 Zuckerberg acknowledged that there is more to do.
 In his Facebook post, Zuckerberg said it will ban developers who don't agree to an audit.
An app's developer will no longer have access to data from people who haven't used that app in three months.
Data will also be generally limited to user names, profile photos and email, unless the developer signs a contract with Facebook and gets user approval.
 In a separate post, Facebook said it will inform people whose data was misused by apps.
Facebook first learned of this breach of privacy more than two years ago, but hadn't mentioned it publicly until Friday.
 The company said it was ""building a way"" for people to know if their data was accessed by ""This Is Your Digital Life,"" the psychological-profiling quiz app that researcher Aleksandr Kogan created and paid about 270,000 people to take part in.
Cambridge Analytica later obtained information from the app for about 50 million Facebook users, as the app also vacuumed up data on people's friends - including those who never downloaded the app or gave explicit consent.
 Chris Wylie, a Cambridge co-founder who left in 2014, has said one of the firm's goals was to influence people's perceptions by injecting content, some misleading or false, all around them.
It's not clear whether Facebook would be able to tell users whether they had seen such content.
 Cambridge has shifted the blame to Kogan, which the firm described as a contractor.
Kogan described himself as a scapegoat.
 Kogan, a psychology researcher at Cambridge University, told the BBC that both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have tried to place the blame on him, even though the firm ensured him that everything he did was legal.
 ""One of the great mistakes I did here was I just didn't ask enough questions,"" he said. ""I had never done a commercial project.
I didn't really have any reason to doubt their sincerity.
That's certainly something I strongly regret now.
"" He said the firm paid some $800,000 for the work, but it went to participants in the survey.
 ""My motivation was to get a dataset I could do research on,"" he said.
""I have never profited from this in any way personally."" Authorities in Britain and the United States are investigating.
 David Carroll, a professor at Parsons School of Design in New York who sued Cambridge Analytica in the U.K., said he was not satisfied with Zuckerberg's response, but acknowledged that ""this is just the beginning."" He said it was ""insane"" that Facebook had yet to take legal action against Cambridge parent SCL Group over the inappropriate data use.
Carroll himself sued Cambridge Friday to recover data on him that the firm had obtained.

50,17970,"['drone footage', 'summit magma', 'magma reservoir', '457 meters', 'magnitude 5.0', 'Geological Survey', 'leilani estates', 'new ground', 'ground cracks']"," HONOLULU (AP) -- Hawaii's Kilauea volcano erupted Thursday, releasing lava into a residential neighborhood and prompting mandatory evacuation orders for nearby homes.
 Hawaii County said steam and lava poured out of a crack in Leilani Estates, which is near the town of Pahoa on the Big Island.
 County, state and federal officials had been warning residents all week that they should be prepared to evacuate, as an eruption would give little warning.
 Hawaii County spokeswoman Janet Snyder said lava emerged Thursday on Mohala Street.
The county has ordered evacuations for homes from Luana Street to Pohohiki Road.
Snyder didn't know how many homes were covered by the evacuation order.
 Leilani Estates has a population of about 1,500, according to the 2010 U.S.
Census.
But the evacuation order only covers a portion of the neighborhood.
 Nearby community centers have opened for shelter.
 The eruption comes after days of earthquakes rattled the area's Puna district.
A nearby school was closed due to the ongoing seismic activity and several roadways cracked under the strain of the constant temblors.
 The Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering a series of earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers.
 The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.
 USGS geologist Janet Babb said the magma crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point, on Tuesday night.
 Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency closed the area to visitors on Tuesday and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.
 Most of Kilauea's activity has been nonexplosive, but a 1924 eruption spewed ash and 10-ton (9-metric ton) rocks into the sky, leaving one man dead.
 Puu Oo's 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 1,500 feet high.
In the decades since, the lava flow has buried dozens of square miles
(kilometers) of land and destroyed many homes.

"," HONOLULU (AP) -- Nearly 1,500 residents were ordered to evacuate from their volcano-side homes after Hawaii's Kilauea Volcano erupted, sending molten lava to chew its way through forest land and bubble up on paved streets.
 Volcano officials couldn't predict how long Thursday's eruption may last, prompting Hawaii's governor to activate the National Guard to help with evacuations and provide security to about 770 structures left empty when residents sought shelter.
 There were no immediate reports of injuries.
 Hawaii County officials said steam and lava poured out of a crack in Leilani Estates, which is near the town of Pahoa on the Big Island.
 Footage shown on local television showed lava spurting into the sky from a crack in a road.
Aerial drone footage showed a line of lava snaking through a forest.
 Resident Jeremiah Osuna captured drone footage of the lava burning through the trees, a scene he described as a ""curtain of fire."" ""It sounded like if you were to put a bunch of rocks into a dryer and turn it on as high as you could. You could just smell sulfur and burning trees and underbrush and stuff,"" he told Honolulu television station KHON.
 Asta Miklius, a geophysicist with the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, told The Associated Press in a phone interview that there is no way to know exactly how long the eruption will continue.
 ""One of the parameters is going to be whether the summit magma reservoir starts to drain in response to this event, and that has not happened yet,"" Miklius said.
""There is quite a bit of magma in the system.
.
It won't be just an hours-long eruption probably, but how long it will last will depend on whether the summit magma reservoir gets involved.
And so we are watching that very, very closely.
"" County, state and federal officials had been warning residents all week that they should be prepared to evacuate, as an eruption would give little warning.
Officials at the U.S.
Geological Survey on Thursday raised the volcano's alert level to warning status, the highest possible, meaning a hazardous eruption is imminent, underway or suspected.
 Nearby community centers have opened for shelter.
 Ranson Yoneda, the recreation director for a Pahoa community center, was readying the gymnasium for evacuees after it was selected as a Red Cross evacuation center.
 He said the people who arrived first were hungry for information.
 ""They just want to know what's going on because they were told it's a mandatory evacuation,"" he said by telephone.
 The U.S.
Geological Survey said new ground cracks were reported Thursday afternoon.
Hot vapor emerged from a crack and spattering lava began to erupt.
 Scientists said areas downslope of the erupting vent were at risk of being covered by lava.
Leilani Estates appeared to be at greatest risk, but scientists said new vents and outbreaks could occur and it's not possible to say where.
 The eruption comes after days of earthquakes rattled the area's Puna district.
A nearby school was closed due to the ongoing seismic activity and several roadways cracked under the strain of the constant temblors.
A magnitude 5.0 earthquake was recorded hours before the eruption began Thursday.
 The Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering a series of earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers.
 The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.

52,8150,"['Facebook photos', 'congressional baseball', ' District of Columbia', 'thursday', 'ammunition', 'veterans affairs', 'affairs facility', 'local police']"," WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Pennsylvania physician who was behaving suspiciously and had made threatening remarks was arrested Wednesday at the Trump International Hotel in Washington after police found an assault-style rifle and handgun in his car, authorities said.
 Bryan Moles of Edinboro, Pennsylvania, was taken into custody at the downtown hotel, where he was staying as a guest, police said.
At a news conference, Metropolitan Police Department Chief Peter Newsham said his department, as well as the Secret Service, received information from the Pennsylvania State Police at about 12:30 a.m. that a tipster had reported that Moles was traveling to the Trump Hotel in Washington, armed with weapons and ammunition.
 Moles, 43, checked into the hotel about 30 minutes later, Newsham said.
Authorities worked with hotel security to locate Moles' car, and later, Moles himself inside the hotel.
 ""I was very concerned about this circumstance,"" Newsham said, ""and I believe the officers and our federal partners, and in particular the tipster, averted a potential disaster here in our nation's capital.
"" The Secret Service said in a statement that special agents from its Washington Field Office, as well as local police officers, began investigating potential threats made against people the agency protects, but at no time were they at risk.
 A police report said authorities saw a firearm in Moles' vehicle and found another inside the glove compartment.
Police seized a Glock 23 pistol, a Bushmaster assault-style rifle and 90 rounds of ammunition.
 Newsham declined to comment on what may have motivated Moles.
 The police chief said Moles is being interviewed, and is cooperating with authorities.
Newsham added that the department does not presently have enough evidence to charge Moles with making threats, although a department spokesman earlier indicated that was part of the tip to Pennsylvania authorities.
 Moles is a physician who practices emergency medicine at a hospital in Erie, Pennsylvania.
He is being charged with carrying a pistol without a license and having unregistered ammunition.
 Hotel spokeswoman Patricia Tang said in a statement that ""authorities arrested a guest who was behaving suspiciously,"" but referred further questions to authorities.
 FBI spokeswoman Minique Crump said the agency initially responded, but referred further questions to the local police, who are taking the lead on the investigation.
 Edinboro is about 100 miles north of Pittsburgh.

"," WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Pennsylvania doctor arrested with guns last month at Trump International Hotel was taken back into custody Thursday after authorities say he returned to the capital and posted Facebook photos of newspaper headlines describing the shooting at the congressional baseball practice.
 Magistrate Judge Robin Meriweather ruled that Bryan Moles, 43, must be held until trial for violating the conditions of his release and must undergo an initial forensic screening to determine his competency, said Bill Miller, a spokesman for the U.S.
Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia.
 An attorney for Moles declined to comment Thursday.
 Moles was arrested May 31 after authorities received a tip about him making threats and traveling to Washington to see the president.
Charging documents say the man told an acquaintance that he was driving to see the president and that he had survival supplies and enough ammunition to make his car resemble Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh ""on a camping trip."" He faces charges of unlawful possession and transportation of a firearm.
He was not licensed to carry a gun in the District of Columbia, which has strict gun laws, authorities said.
 A judge told Moles on June 2 that he could be released until his trial but must participate in a mental health evaluation and treatment at a Veterans Affairs facility in Georgia.
He was told he must also stay away from Washington unless the visit is connected to his case, and when in Washington he must stay away from the Trump Hotel and the White House.
 Assistant U.S.
Attorney Michael Friedman asked the court Wednesday to revoke Moles' pre-trial release, saying in a filing that Moles was discharged Monday from the Veterans Affairs facility in Georgia ""against medical advice"" after he refused to comply with his treatment.
 His discharge came two days after prosecutors say Moles tampered with a sprinkler system at the VA facility, causing his room to flood.
 Moles also left a threatening voice message for a female witness in the case and a close family member has expressed ""serious concern"" about his mental state, Friedman wrote.
 On Thursday, Friedman told the court that Moles returned to Washington early that morning ""apparently to purchase and consume drugs."" Moles also posted photos Thursday on Facebook of newspapers describing the shooting of Rep.
Steve Scalise, Friedman said.
The newspapers were placed in the photos next to a black bag with ""unknown contents,"" he said.
 ""The defendant squandered his opportunity to be released pending trial and demonstrated that detention is necessary to ensure the safety of the community,"" the prosecutor said.

The nodules were discovered during tests following a fall in November in which Justice Ginsburg fractured her ribs.
The surgery, a pulmonary lobectomy, took place at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.
According to the justice’s thoracic surgeon, Dr. Valerie W. Rusch, the nodules removed during surgery were found to be malignant, Ms. Arberg said in a statement.

26. The new tumors could be primary lung cancers, meaning they originated in the lung.
Or they could be growths that spread to her lung from cancer in another organ.
“When you have two lesions in the lung, it usually means it came from someplace else,” said Dr. Raja Flores, chairman of thoracic surgery at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in Manhattan.
“It’s probably something that spread from the pancreas to the lungs.
” That Justice Ginsburg is alive 10 years after being treated for pancreatic cancer — which is often rapidly fatal — indicates that she probably had a relatively slow-growing form of the disease.
Therefore, Dr. Flores said, he expected that the tumors in her lungs would also tend to be slow-growing, what he calls “turtles.
” Testing on the tissue removed during surgery will determine the diagnosis, he said.

54,1911132,"['unemployment rate', 'surfaces', 'symptoms', 'paid leave', 'Consumer spending', 'Jay Powell', 'Federal Reserve', 'hard surfaces']","Analysts around the world slashed their 2020 economic forecasts as the coronavirus continued to spread beyond China and weak Asian data offered an early hint at the infection’s cost to business.
One major multinational group warned global growth could be cut in half if the infection spreads widely.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said that if the outbreak sweeps through the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North America, global growth could fall to just 1.5 percent in 2020, far less than the 3 percent it projected before the virus surfaced.
“This scenario would put Japan and Europe in recession, and the U.S. close to zero,” Laurence Boone, the organization’s chief economist, told reporters during a conference call Monday.
She added, “This is not a worst-case scenario.
” The impact could be even more dire if the outbreak spreads beyond Asia, Europe and the United States and into the southern hemisphere, she said.
Even if the outbreak is mild and mostly contained outside China — the O.E.C.D.’s expected scenario — global growth could be lowered about half a percentage point relative to previous forecasts, according to an update that the group released on Monday ominously titled, “Coronavirus: The World Economy at Risk.
” The spread of the coronavirus has sent markets reeling as investors anticipate painful economic fallout.
Economists across Wall Street revised their 2020 outlooks sharply downward.
Updated Feb. 26, 2020 Goldman Sachs economists expect global growth to slump to around 2 percent for the full year, down from their previous 3 percent forecast, but said in a note Friday that there are risks of a worldwide recession if the virus becomes a more severe global pandemic.
Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note Monday that in a good scenario, global growth will fall to 2.5 percent this year — the weakest pace since 2009.
In a bad scenario, it could shrink by 0.5 percent, a contraction on scale with the financial crisis.
Analysts from the O.E.C.D., a forum of 36 countries meant to foster cooperation and trade, stopped short of forecasting an all-out global downturn.
But they stressed that there was potential for the economic impact to become much worse and said that governments should already be pouring resources into health care and taking measures to support businesses hit by slumping sales.
“Regardless of how the virus spreads in coming days and months, we call on governments to take action now,” Ms. Boone said.
The economic risks posed by the coronavirus are unpredictable.
It is unclear how far and fast infections will spread, making it hard to estimate the economic fallout from such actions as widespread quarantines and supply chain disruptions.
Outbreaks in China, Japan, Iran, Italy and South Korea have already closed many factories and slowed or halted tourism.
Even in the United States, which has had few cases, major companies like Twitter and Amazon have told their employees to avoid nonessential travel.
Chinese data already suggest unexpectedly large economic costs.
Two gauges of manufacturing activity slumped in February, with the Caixin manufacturing index falling to the lowest level in its history in data released Monday.
Real-time trackers of Chinese activity, from coal consumption to property sales, remain severely depressed.
Central banks have signaled that they stand ready to act as the damage mounts, and investors have begun looking to the Federal Reserve and its global counterparts for relief.
The Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, released a statement on Friday pledging that the central bank would “act as appropriate” to protect growth.
The Bank of Japan and Bank of England issued statements of their own on Monday, signaling preparedness.
“The Fed-led pivot reflects the global spread of the virus and its economic disruptions, sharp equity market weakness and an emerging realization that corporate cash flow problems could create strains in credit markets,” Krishna Guha and Ernie Tedeschi at Evercore ISI wrote in a note following the announcements.
Ms. Boone said that she welcomed expressions of resolve by central banks, but that the onus was also on governments.
For example, political leaders could provide incentives for companies to shorten work hours rather than lay people off, or delay tax payments for small businesses suffering from plunging sales.
Ms. Boone said it would be “a very positive signal” if the United States and China were to drop the tariffs they had imposed as part of a trade war.
“This is not a shock that central banks alone can address,” Ms. Boone said.
“It really, really  needs to be accompanied by fiscal measures.
” The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said on Monday that the government would “unlock whatever it takes” to help French companies.
“We will show complete solidarity vis-à-vis all contractors that today are on the front line,” he said.
Even under the O.E.C.D.’s main scenario, in which the virus is quickly contained, its economists anticipate that China’s central bank and many of its global counterparts would lower interest rates  a quarter percentage point or more.
That said, the report went on, “There is limited need for further reductions in policy interest rates in the United States unless the risks of a sharper growth slowdown rise.
” Should the virus spread more widely, countries that have room to cut rates are likely to lower them by 1 percentage point on average in 2020, according to the report.
But central banks in South Korea, the United Kingdom, and Australia all have limited room to lower borrowing costs, which are already low, and would hit zero in the report’s scenario.
“The increasing constraints on monetary policy suggest that a swift and sizable discretionary fiscal response would be needed in event of a scenario of this type occurring,” the O.E.C.D. said.
“This reinforces the need for stronger global policy cooperation.
” The sharp drop in stock markets last week “adds to the persisting financial vulnerabilities from the tensions between slower growth, high corporate debt and deteriorating credit quality, including in China,” the report said.
“These developments raise the risk of significant corporate stress if risk aversion intensifies from already high levels.
” Ms. Boone said she was concerned that the outbreak could undermine businesses confidence and prompt companies to cut back on hiring and investment at a time when global growth was already weak.
“All in all, the global economic situation before the virus hit was not that robust,” she said.

","Global policymakers moved to ease public anxiety over the coming economic hit from the coronavirus on Monday, as analysts warned of a severe slowdown in growth and a possible recession if the virus continued to spread.
Finance ministers and central bankers from the world’s advanced economies said the Group of 7 would hold an emergency call on Tuesday morning to discuss economic responses to the outbreak.
The World Bank and International Monetary Fund signaled they were also ready to provide assistance, particularly to poor nations.
Monetary policymakers from Japan to Europe on Monday pledged to act as needed to stem any economic fallout as infections spread.
The rush of reassurance came amid increasingly dire economic projections tied to the coronavirus, which is spreading outside of China to South Korea, Italy, France and the United States, idling factories, quarantining workers and curtailing international travel.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said global growth could plummet to just 1.5 percent in 2020, far less than the 3 percent it projected before the virus surfaced, should the outbreak sweep through the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North America.
If things get bad enough, Japan and Europe could plunge into recession, the O.E.C.D. warned.
Predictions for the United States were nearly as bad: Most analysts expect zero or negative growth in the second quarter, with some forecasting a potential recession before year’s end.
That glum outlook sent stocks in Europe temporarily lower, but expectations for a far-reaching global response — including the potential for a coordinated interest rate across central banks — helped to stem market bleeding.
The S&
P 500 posted its best gain in more than a year, rising by more than 4.6 percent, amid a surge in interest-rate sensitive sectors such as utilities and real estate.
Treasury yields continued to tumble, hitting a record low, as investors bet that the Fed will cut interest rates by half a percentage point at its next meeting.
“It has already stoked expectations of a coordinated cut,” Roberto Perli, a former Federal Reserve researcher who is now an economist at Cornerstone Macro, said in an email following news of the G7 meeting.
“If it doesn’t happen, it will only add to market volatility.
” President Trump joined in pushing for Fed action on Monday, saying that Chair Jerome H. Powell and his colleagues should quickly slash interest rates as economic risk from the virus becomes more stark.
“As usual, Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve are slow to act,” he wrote on Twitter.
Later, when asked about the state of the economy amid a tumultuous financial week, the president noted that “the market’s up today” and insisted, “Our country’s very strong economically.
” But he said he would like the Federal Reserve to do more to address the financial challenges posed by the spread of the coronavirus.
“I don’t think the Fed’s looking at it,” he said, “but they should be.
A senior administration official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the administration’s response, said Mr. Trump and his advisers were not discussing any fiscal stimulus measures, such as immediate tax cuts, because they viewed any damage from the coronavirus as likely to be temporary.
Still, the official said, the White House wants the Fed to cut rates, in part to halt a decline in commodity prices.
Mr. Powell has not committed to lowering borrowing costs, which are already in a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent, lower than in previous expansions.
But he signaled on Friday that the Fed was ready to act to support the economy.
Investors now expect the Fed to slash rates by half a percentage point at its March meeting or even before, and see borrowing costs drop as much as a full point lower by the end of the year.
Even if the outbreak is mild and mostly contained outside China — the O.E.C.D.’s expected scenario — global growth could be reduced about half a percentage point relative to previous forecasts, according to an update that the group released on Monday ominously titled “Coronavirus: The World Economy at Risk.
” Goldman Sachs economists expect global growth to slump to around 2 percent for the full year, down from their previous 3 percent forecast.
Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note Monday that in a good scenario, global growth will fall to 2.5 percent this year — the weakest pace since 2009.
In a bad scenario, it could shrink by 0.5 percent, a contraction on a scale with the financial crisis.
Growth in the United States is also at risk from the virus, especially if the number of infections continues to rise.
Goldman Sachs economists said in a note Sunday that “while the U.S. economy avoids recession in our baseline forecast, the downside risks have clearly grown.
” Deutsche Bank’s economics team changed its baseline forecast to expect the economy to shrink in the second quarter, with the stock market falling 20 percent below its recent peak, before rebounding in the fall.
Its new “worse case” forecast sees the United States entering recession before year end.
The exact outcome is hard to quantify because the risks posed by the coronavirus are inherently unpredictable.
It is unclear how far infections will spread, making it difficult to estimate the economic fallout from such actions as widespread quarantines and supply chain disruptions.
Outbreaks in China, Japan, Iran, Italy and South Korea have already closed many factories and slowed or halted tourism.
Even in the United States, which has had few cases, major companies like Twitter and Amazon have curbed business travel.
The economic impact is slowly filtering through the real economy.
Priya Misra, a rates strategist, spends a lot of time thinking about the path of economic growth, so it raised alarm bells in her mind when her employer, TD Securities, cut her international business trip short last week.
Updated June 24, 2020 Scientists around the country have tried to identify everyday materials that do a good job of filtering microscopic particles.
In recent tests, HEPA furnace filters scored high, as did vacuum cleaner bags, fabric similar to flannel pajamas and those of 600-count pillowcases.
Other materials tested included layered coffee filters and scarves and bandannas.
These scored lower, but still captured a small percentage of particles.
A commentary published this month on the website of the British Journal of Sports Medicine points out that covering your face during exercise “comes with issues of potential breathing restriction and discomfort” and requires “balancing benefits versus possible adverse events.
” Masks do alter exercise, says Cedric X. Bryant, the president and chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise, a nonprofit organization that funds exercise research and certifies fitness professionals.
“In my personal experience,” he says, “heart rates are higher at the same relative intensity when you wear a mask.
” Some people also could experience lightheadedness during familiar workouts while masked, says Len Kravitz, a professor of exercise science at the University of New Mexico.
The steroid, dexamethasone, is the first treatment shown to reduce mortality in severely ill patients, according to scientists in Britain.
The drug appears to reduce inflammation caused by the immune system, protecting the tissues.
In the study, dexamethasone reduced deaths of patients on ventilators by one-third, and deaths of patients on oxygen by one-fifth.
The coronavirus emergency relief package gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the virus.
It gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking diagnosis or preventive care for coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members.
It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus.
It is the first time the United States has had widespread federally mandated paid leave, and includes people who don’t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers.
But the measure excludes at least half of private-sector workers, including those at the country’s largest employers, and gives small employers significant leeway to deny leave.
So far, the evidence seems to show it does.
A widely cited paper published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was “very rare,”  but she later walked back that statement.
Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads.
But it can happen.
A number of studies of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and hospitals.
But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way.
The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks.
A study by European scientists is the first to document a strong statistical link between genetic variations and Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.
Having Type A blood was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study.
The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected.
Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14.7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II.
But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April.
Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.
Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common.
The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for.
Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.
If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself.
Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face.
If possible, choose a window seat.
A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people.
Disinfect hard surfaces.
When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table.
If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too.
(Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor.
They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.
It was part of the company’s new ban on nonessential trips.
Her concern only grew on Monday, as clients who were planning to come to her from other parts of the United States rescheduled in-person meetings to phone calls.
And it crescendoed when an out-of-town client told her not to drive to their office — outsiders were no longer allowed into the building.
“That’s why I think the growth impact is still not understood — people don’t travel, people don’t plan vacations,” she said.
“Manufacturing was already weak, but will we now see it in consumer spending?” If they last, preventive measures like travel limits and partial quarantine could have far-reaching implications.
Airlines, hotels and conference centers might suffer.
Consumer spending, the backbone of an 11-year-long economic expansion in the United States, could weaken.
In China, where the virus has raged for about two months, data already suggest unexpectedly large economic costs.
Two gauges of manufacturing activity slumped in February, with the Caixin manufacturing index falling to the lowest level in its history, according to data released Monday.
Real-time trackers of Chinese activity, from coal consumption to property sales, remain severely depressed.

“The Fed-led pivot reflects the global spread of the virus and its economic disruptions, sharp equity market weakness and an emerging realization that corporate cash flow problems could create strains in credit markets,” Krishna Guha and Ernie Tedeschi at Evercore ISI wrote in a note after the announcements.
But central bankers have far less room to loosen monetary policy today than they did heading into the 2007 recession.
In the United States, the federal funds rate was above 5 percent back then and was ultimately lowered to near zero.
Laurence Boone, chief economist at the O.E.C.D., said in a conference call on Monday that she welcomed expressions of resolve by central banks, but that the onus was also on elected officials.
“Regardless of how the virus spreads in coming days and months, we call on governments to take action now,” Ms. Boone told reporters.
Political leaders could provide incentives for companies to shorten work hours rather than lay people off, or delay tax payments for small businesses suffering from plunging sales, for example.

55,1927808,"['July 21', 'August 4']","LONDON — Queen Elizabeth II, in a rare televised address on Sunday evening, will try to rally her fellow Britons to confront the coronavirus pandemic with the resolve and self-discipline that have seen the nation through its greatest trials.
“I am speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time,” the queen will say in taped remarks from Windsor Castle, where she has sequestered herself against a virus that has infected at least 40,000 people in Britain, including her eldest son and heir, Prince Charles, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
In excerpts released by Buckingham Palace, the queen calls it “a time of disruption in the life of our country: a disruption that has brought grief to some, financial difficulties to many, and enormous changes to the daily lives of us all.
” It is only the fourth time in her 66-year reign that the queen has addressed the British people, apart from her annual Christmas greeting — and it carries a distinct echo of the celebrated radio address her father, George VI, delivered in September 1939, as Britain stood on the brink of war with Germany.
The queen’s speech, like the king’s eight decades ago, will appeal to the quintessential British traits of stoicism and solidarity.
It is meant to pull the country together to vanquish an enemy that brings death not in the terrifying bombing raids of the Blitz but in the ordinary encounters of people transmitting a dangerous pathogen.
“I hope in the years to come, everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge,” the queen will say, “and those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any.
That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humored resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterize this country.
” Buckingham Palace took extraordinary measures to protect the queen, who turns 94 this month, from infection.
She recorded the speech in a large room with only a single camera operator, according to a palace official.
The operator wore a mask and gloves while a skeleton crew monitored from another room.
Fears for the queen’s health grew after Prince Charles announced two weeks ago that he was suffering mild symptoms of the virus.
He had met his mother on March 12, only a day before his medical advisers assessed that he might have been infectious.
After isolating himself for seven days at Birkhall, his residence in Scotland, Charles re-emerged, via a video link from Scotland, to dedicate a new field hospital for coronavirus patients that was constructed in less than two weeks in a cavernous convention center in London’s Docklands.
Mr. Johnson remains in isolation in his flat next door to 10 Downing Street, where officials said he was still running a high temperature.
On Saturday, his 32-year-old girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, disclosed that she, too, is suffering symptoms.
Ms. Symonds is pregnant;
the couple announced last month that they were engaged.
Other senior officials, including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, have also had to isolate themselves because of symptoms.
With 41,903 confirmed cases, and 4,313 deaths, Britain appears to be following the same grim trajectory as other European countries.
The British government, however, came late to the need for social distancing, with Mr. Johnson initially balking at ordering pubs and restaurants to close.
He is now an ardent convert and recorded a video from his quarantine urging people — without much success — not to flock to London parks during a sun-kissed spring weekend.
The queen has expressed no qualms about cutting social contacts.
She canceled her public schedule and left Buckingham Palace on March 19, four days before Mr. Johnson ordered a lockdown across the country.
Her 98-year-old husband, Prince Philip, was flown to Windsor Castle by helicopter from his residence on the grounds of Sandringham, another of the queen’s residences.
After Prince Charles announced his illness, Buckingham Palace said the queen was healthy.
But it has not issued any updates on her condition.
The palace did not comment on a recent report in a British tabloid, The Sun, that one of the queen’s footmen, who walks her dogs, had contracted the virus.
Although the royal family has endured a litany of bad news in the last year — from the bitter departure of Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, to the messy dealings of Prince Andrew with the disgraced financier and convicted sexual predator, Jeffrey Epstein — the queen remains a revered figure among many Britons.
She has used her lofty stature sparingly outside of her official schedule of investitures, diplomatic receptions and regular meetings with the prime minister (she and Mr. Johnson conducted their most recent one by phone).
Her speech will include familiar touches, like an expression of thanks to the doctors and nurses of the National Health Service, something she has done in countless statements after natural disasters.
At 8 p.m. every Thursday, people now gather at their windows or doorways to applaud the health workers.
By custom, the queen addresses the nation on Christmas Day.
The only other times that she has given a televised address were in 1991 during the Persian Gulf war, before the funeral of Princess Diana in 1997, and after the death of the Queen Mother in 2002.
But the demands of social distancing have prevented the queen from playing the kind of highly visible role that she and previous monarchs have played during national emergencies.
Her father and mother, Elizabeth, toured neighborhoods that had been bombed by the Germans during the Blitz in 1940 and 1941.
Elizabeth, who was known later as the Queen Mother, said after Buckingham Palace was bombed in September 1940 that she could “look the East End in the face,” referring to the working-class neighborhoods of East London.
Princess Elizabeth, the future queen, worked in the auxiliary service as a driver and truck mechanic during World War II.
That experience left a lasting imprint on her and makes her a living link to Britain’s wartime experience.
Her speech, with its appeal to national solidarity but also its blunt acknowledgment of the trials to come, will have many of the same themes of her father’s address, memorialized in the 2010 film, “The King’s Speech,” which starred Colin Firth as George VI and Geoffrey Rush as his speech therapist.
“In this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history,” the king said in halting cadences, “I send to every household of my peoples, both at home and overseas, this message.
” The coming conflict, he said, “will be hard.
There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
”
","LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson was hospitalized on Sunday evening after 10 days of battling the coronavirus, unnerving a country that had gathered to watch Queen Elizabeth II rally fellow Britons to confront the pandemic and reassure them that when the crisis finally ebbed, “we will meet again.
” The British government said that Mr. Johnson would be undergoing tests and that he would continue to carry out his duties.
But the uncertainty generated by his persistent illness underscored the sense of crisis that led the queen to address the country in a rare televised speech that evoked the darkest days of World War II.
“I am speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time,” the queen said.
“A disruption that has brought grief to some, financial difficulties to many, and enormous changes to the daily lives of us all.
” Her remarks were taped at Windsor Castle, where she has sequestered herself against a virus that has infected at least 40,000 people in Britain, including her eldest son and heir, Prince Charles, and other senior British officials besides Mr. Johnson.
Speaking in terms both personal and historical, the queen likened the enforced separation of Britain’s lockdown to the sacrifices families made during World War II, when parents sent away their children for their own safety.
She urged a country that has approached these measures with some nonchalance to commit itself to the cause.
“Today, once again, many will feel a painful sense of separation from their loved ones,” the queen said.
“But now, as then, we know, deep down, that it is the right thing to do.
” Before being transferred to the hospital, Mr. Johnson, 55, had been in isolation in his apartment next door to 10 Downing Street, where officials said he was running a high temperature.
Early last week, Mr. Johnson’s aides said they expected him to end his self-isolation on Friday.
But he still looked visibly weakened when he made a statement in a video late in the week.
[Analysis: Peaks, testing and lockdowns: How coronavirus vocabulary causes confusion.
] “On the advice of his doctor, the prime minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests,” a spokesman said Sunday.
“This is a precautionary step, as the prime minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive for the virus.
” The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is expected to lead the daily cabinet meeting on the pandemic on Monday.
Under the government’s succession plan, Mr. Raab would take up Mr. Johnson’s duties if he is incapacitated.
Mr. Johnson’s hospitalization is a stark illustration of how deeply the virus has struck governments around the world, sickening officials from Britain to Brazil, killing a senior aide to the supreme leader of Iran, and sending the leaders of Germany and Canada into isolation.
The queen’s speech was among only a handful of times in her 68-year reign in which she has addressed the British people, apart from her annual Christmas greeting — and it carried a distinct echo of the celebrated radio address her father, George VI, delivered in September 1939, as Britain stood on the brink of war with Germany.
Like the king eight decades ago, the queen appealed to the quintessential British traits of stoicism and solidarity, and explicitly linked the pandemic to the war as a defining moment for modern Britain.
This time, she said, the country needs to come together to vanquish an enemy that brings death not in the terrifying bombing raids of the Blitz but in the ordinary encounters of people transmitting a dangerous pathogen.
“I hope in the years to come, everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge,” the queen said, “and those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any.

He is now an ardent convert and recorded a video from his quarantine urging people — without much success — not to flock to London parks during a sun-kissed spring weekend.
Britain’s response to the pandemic has improved since that shaky start.
The government has vowed to conduct 100,000 virus tests a week by the end of April, a tenfold increase over the current rate.
And worries that the National Health Service would be overwhelmed by the surge of patients have subsided somewhat.
The queen herself has expressed no qualms about cutting social contacts.
She canceled her public schedule and left Buckingham Palace on March 19, four days before Mr. Johnson ordered a lockdown across the country.
Her 98-year-old husband, Prince Philip, was flown to Windsor Castle by helicopter from his residence on the grounds of Sandringham, another of the queen’s residences.
After Prince Charles announced his illness, Buckingham Palace said the queen was healthy, and it has not issued any updates on her condition.
But in her appearance on Sunday, seated next to a writing desk with a flowering plant, she looked alert and at ease.
The palace did not comment on a recent report in a British tabloid, The Sun, that one of the queen’s footmen, who walks her dogs, had contracted the virus.

Reaction to her speech was close to rapturous, across the political spectrum.
“What an inspiring, steadying, reassuring Address by the Queen.
Not a false note,” declared Nicholas Soames, a Conservative former member of Parliament and grandson of Winston Churchill, on Twitter.
Keir Starmer, the newly elected leader of the Labour Party, said, “The Queen speaks for the whole country, and our determination to beat the coronavirus.
” Still, the demands of social distancing have prevented the queen from playing the kind of highly visible role that she and previous monarchs have played during national emergencies.

That experience left a lasting imprint on her and makes her a living link to Britain’s wartime experience.
In one of the most personal moments of her speech, the queen referred to her first radio address, recorded by her and her sister, Princess Margaret, in 1940 for children who had been evacuated from their homes for their safety.
“We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return,” the queen said.
“We will be with our friends again;
we will be with our families again;
we will meet again.
” The last line referred to “We’ll Meet Again,” a 1939 song that became a wartime favorite in Britain.
With its appeal to wartime solidarity and its blunt acknowledgment of the trials to come, the speech had many of the same themes of her father’s address, memorialized in the 2010 film, “The King’s Speech,” which starred Colin Firth as George VI and Geoffrey Rush as his speech therapist.

56,1913110,"['social distancing', 'unemployment rate', 'surfaces', 'hard surfaces', 'regular exercise', 'tested', 'hand washing']","In the fight against the coronavirus, nurses play a critical role, but some on the front lines in the hardest-hit areas in the United States say they fear that their health is not being made a priority.
Nurses in Washington State and California said they have had to beg for N95 masks, which are thicker than surgical masks and block out much smaller particles, and have faced ridicule from colleagues when expressing concerns about catching the highly contagious virus.
Some have complained about being pulled out of quarantine early to treat patients because of staff shortages.
“If nurses aren’t safe, then really our community isn’t safe,” said Jenny Managhebi, a clinical nurse at the University of California, Davis, Medical Center, where 24 nurses were asked to self-quarantine after a patient tested positive for the virus.
“If I’m not safe at the bedside, when I come home to my husband and my children, then they’re not safe.
” Concerns from nurses in Washington State and California echo those of nurses nationwide.
National Nurses United, a union that represents about 150,000 nurses across the country, announced on Thursday the sobering results of an online survey it recently conducted.
Of the 6,500 nurses who participated, 29 percent said their hospitals had a plan in place to isolate potential coronavirus patients, and 44 percent said they had received guidance from their employers about how to handle the virus.
Sixty-three percent had access to N95 face masks, and a quarter of the respondents had access to an even more protective mask recommended by the union, known as a PAPR, or a powered air purifying respirator.
One California nurse, who is in a 14-day self-quarantine after caring for a coronavirus patient, complained that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not testing her for the virus quickly enough.
“This is not the ticket dispenser at the deli counter;
it’s a public health emergency!” she wrote in a statement shared by National Nurses United.
At a news conference on Thursday afternoon, the union demanded, among other things, that the federal government ensure all health care workers receive the highest levels of protective equipment, that any vaccine that is developed be offered to the public for free, and that Congress immediately pass an emergency spending package in response to the virus.
“The C.D.C. has been behind the ball at almost every step of the way,” said Jane Thomason, a union official who focuses on workplace health and safety.
Medical professionals have died in Wuhan, China, where the new coronavirus first surfaced late last year.
Health care workers are among the groups most at risk of contracting the virus, as sick people report to emergency rooms and are treated before their condition is known.
At least eight people who work in U.S. health care facilities have received a coronavirus diagnosis, including three employees of a hospital in Vacaville, Calif.
, and five people who worked at the Life Care long-term care facility in Kirkland, Wash.
And health care workers who are exposed to it can also unwittingly transmit the virus.
At EvergreenHealth, a hospital in Kirkland where at least 11 deaths have occurred, nurses who were told to self-quarantine were later asked to return to work, according to the Washington State Nurses Association, raising fears that they could further spread the virus if they had contracted it.
The association, which represents more than 16,000 registered nurses in the state, surveyed its members and reported that 40 percent of the Evergreen nurses who responded said they lacked access to adequate protective equipment.
More than half said they did not feel prepared to provide care for a patient with a known or suspected case of the virus, which causes a disease known as Covid-19.
The union said nurses at other hospitals around the state have also reported concerns about lack of equipment.
“Some have expressed concern that they themselves or colleagues have been in close contact with Covid-19 patients and yet are being told to continue working,” the union said.
Mary Shepler, the chief nursing officer at EvergreenHealth, which includes the hospital in Kirkland, defended the facility’s preparedness and protocols.
The hospital, she said, has adequate supplies, including single-use masks and face shields that are sterilized and reused.
The hospital, too, has conducted drills and training for such situations, Ms. Shepler said, adding that she understands the stress that people are under while dealing with a new virus.
“It’s uncomfortable to all of us in this new zone,” she said.
Ms. Shepler said that after quarantining some workers who were exposed to coronavirus patients, the hospital determined that the extent of the quarantine was unrealistic because it left shortages in a needed work force.
They brought nurses back who were asymptomatic — an approach deemed reasonable by the C.D.C., she said — and are testing them twice a shift.
They are also required to wear masks while treating patients.
The California Nurses Association, a statewide union that has grown into the largest organization of nurses in the country, with representation of 155,000 nurses, is scheduled to hold a news conference on Thursday afternoon to demand access to “the highest level of protection” for nurses on the front lines.
It also plans to demand training and clear plans for how to handle patients suspected of having the virus.
“Employers shall plan for a surge of patients with possible or confirmed Covid-19, including plans to isolate, cohort, and to provide safe staffing,” the union said in a statement.
“Any nurse/health care worker who is exposed to Covid-19 will be placed on precautionary leave for at least 14 days and will maintain pay and other benefits during the full length of that leave.
” Updated August 27, 2020 Some nurses at other hospitals have reported being asked to take their personal paid leave to cover periods of mandatory quarantine.
California has one of the strictest nurse-to-patient ratios in the country, with one nurse for every two sick patients in intensive care units.
Some nurses said they were concerned that hospitals would struggle to meet that quotient if too many were forced into quarantine.
Training for how to use protective gear, nurses said, is almost as important as the gear itself, because taking it off incorrectly can result in spreading dangerous fluids from a sick patient.
“It used to be that you’d get a full day training,” said Gerard Brogan, the director of nursing practice at the California Nurses Association.
“Now, they will send a nurse and doctor to the internet to learn how to don and doff a hazmat suit.
” A nurse at a hospital run by Tenet Healthcare in Orange County who spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals, said staff members have not been told what to do if a possible coronavirus patient walks into the emergency room.
The nurse said some doctors have ridiculed staff members who have raised concerns.
“It’s been pretty disturbing what is happening,” said the nurse, who is among the most experienced nurses at the hospital.
“Some doctors have been walking through the hospital for weeks with respirator masks.
Others have been brushing it off like, ‘If you think this is a big deal, you are a conspiracy theorist and you are weak.
’” A spokeswoman for the hospital network said the hospitals were prepared to care for coronavirus patients and were working to protect the health and safety of staff members.
Ms. Managhebi, the clinical nurse in California, said nurses have asked that N95 masks be made available on the supply carts in their units, rather than having to ask a manager or an assistant manager for one, as is the current practice.
She also said nurses wanted the UC Davis hospital to adopt a detailed set of protocols about how they should handle suspected coronavirus cases, similar to a plan for Ebola that stipulated everything from the elevator that would be used to transport a patient to the specific staff members who would treat the patient.
But, Ms. Managhebi said, “They responded to our request and said it wasn’t necessary at this time.
” Dana Goldstein and Mitch Smith contributed reporting.
","In the fight against the coronavirus, nurses play a critical role, but some on the front lines in the hardest-hit areas in the United States say they fear that their health is not being made a priority.
Nurses in Washington State and California said they have had to beg for N95 masks, which are thicker than surgical masks and block out much smaller particles, and have faced ridicule from colleagues when expressing concerns about catching the highly contagious virus.
Some have complained about being pulled out of quarantine early to treat patients because of staff shortages.

” Updated June 16, 2020 The steroid, dexamethasone, is the first treatment shown to reduce mortality in severely ill patients, according to scientists in Britain.
The drug appears to reduce inflammation caused by the immune system, protecting the tissues.
In the study, dexamethasone reduced deaths of patients on ventilators by one-third, and deaths of patients on oxygen by one-fifth.
The coronavirus emergency relief package gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the virus.
It gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking diagnosis or preventive care for coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members.
It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus.
It is the first time the United States has had widespread federally mandated paid leave, and includes people who don’t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers.
But the measure excludes at least half of private-sector workers, including those at the country’s largest employers, and gives small employers significant leeway to deny leave.
So far, the evidence seems to show it does.
A widely cited paper published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was “very rare,”  but she later walked back that statement.
Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads.
But it can happen.
A number of studies of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and hospitals.
But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way.
The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks.
A study by European scientists is the first to document a strong statistical link between genetic variations and Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.
Having Type A blood was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study.
The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected.
Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14.7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II.
But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April.
Mass protests against police brutality that have brought thousands of people onto the streets in cities across America are raising the specter of new coronavirus outbreaks, prompting political leaders, physicians and public health experts to warn that the crowds could cause a surge in cases.
While many political leaders affirmed the right of protesters to express themselves, they urged the demonstrators to wear face masks and maintain social distancing, both to protect themselves and to prevent further community spread of the virus.
Some infectious disease experts were reassured by the fact that the protests were held outdoors, saying the open air settings could mitigate the risk of transmission.
States are reopening bit by bit.
This means that more public spaces are available for use and more and more businesses are being allowed to open again.
The federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities.
Even if you aren’t being told to stay at home, it’s still a good idea to limit trips outside and your interaction with other people.
Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.
Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common.
The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for.
Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.
If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself.
Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face.
If possible, choose a window seat.
A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people.
Disinfect hard surfaces.
When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table.
If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too.
(Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.) Taking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.
If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.
The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public.
This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms.
Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing.
Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply.
Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.
If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor.
They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.
If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears.
They will decide if you need to be tested.
Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.

57,1928371,"['12', '26', '\tlatest climate', 'climate change', 'change news']","WASHINGTON — Coronavirus patients in areas that had high levels of air pollution before the pandemic are far more likely to die from the infection than patients in cleaner parts of the country, according to a new nationwide study that offers the first clear link between long-term exposure to pollution and Covid-19 death rates.
In an analysis of 3,080 counties in the United States, researchers at the Harvard University T.H.
Chan School of Public Health found that higher levels of the tiny, dangerous particles in air known as PM 2.5 were associated with higher death rates from the disease.
For weeks, public health officials have surmised a link between dirty air and death or serious illness from Covid-19, which is caused by the coronavirus.
The Harvard analysis is the first nationwide study to show a statistical link, revealing a “large overlap” between Covid-19 deaths and other diseases associated with long-term exposure to fine particulate matter.
“The results of this paper suggest that long-term exposure to air pollution increases vulnerability to experiencing the most severe Covid-19 outcomes,” the authors wrote.
The paper found that if Manhattan had lowered its average particulate matter level by just a single unit, or one microgram per cubic meter, over the past 20 years, the borough would most likely have seen 248 fewer Covid-19 deaths by this point in the outbreak.
Over all, the research could have significant implications for how public health officials choose to allocate resources like ventilators and respirators as the coronavirus spreads.
The paper has been fast-tracked for peer review and publication in the New England Journal of Medicine.
It found that just a slight increase in long-term pollution exposure could have serious coronavirus-related consequences, even accounting for other factors like smoking rates and population density.
For example, it found that a person living for decades in a county with high levels of fine particulate matter is 15 times more likely to die from the coronavirus than someone in a region with one unit less of the fine particulate pollution.
The District of Columbia, for instance, is likely to have a higher death rate than the adjacent Montgomery County, Md.
Cook County, Ill.
, which includes Chicago, should be worse than nearby Lake County, Ill.
Fulton County, Ga.
, which includes Atlanta, is likely to suffer more deaths than the adjacent Douglas County.
“This study provides evidence that counties that have more polluted air will experience higher risks of death for Covid-19,” said Francesca Dominici, a professor of biostatistics at Harvard who led the study.
Counties with higher pollution levels, Dr. Dominici said, “will be the ones that will have higher numbers of hospitalizations, higher numbers of deaths and where many of the resources should be concentrated.
” The study is part of a small but growing body of research, mostly still out of Europe, that offers a view into how a lifetime of breathing dirtier air can make people more susceptible to the coronavirus, which has already killed more than 10,000 people in the United States and 74,000 worldwide.
In the short term, Dr. Domenici and other public health experts said the study’s finding meant that places like the Central Valley of California, or Cuyahoga County, Ohio, may need to prepare for more severe cases of Covid-19.
The analysis did not look at individual patient data and did not answer why some parts of the country have been hit harder than others.
It also remains unclear whether particulate matter pollution plays any role in the spread of the coronavirus or whether long-term exposure directly leads to a greater risk of falling ill.
Dr. John R. Balmes, a spokesman for the American Lung Association and a professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco, said the findings were particularly important for hospitals in poor neighborhoods and communities of color, which tend to be exposed to higher levels of air pollution than affluent, white communities.
“We need to make sure that hospitals taking care of folks who are more vulnerable and with even greater air pollution exposure have the resources they need,” Dr. Balmes said.
As more is learned about the recurrence of Covid-19, the study also could have far-reaching implications for clean-air regulations, which the Trump administration has worked to roll back over the past three years on the grounds that they have been onerous to industry.
“The study results underscore the importance of continuing to enforce existing air pollution regulations to protect human health both during and after the Covid-19 crisis,” the study said.
Last week, the Trump administration announced a plan to weaken Obama-era regulations on automobile tailpipe emissions, asserting the rollback would save lives because Americans would buy newer, safer vehicles.
But the administration’s own analysis also found that there would be even more premature deaths from increased air pollution.
In weakening a regulation last year on carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants, the Environmental Protection Agency similarly acknowledged that the measure was likely to result in about 1,400 additional premature deaths a year because of more pollution.
Asked whether the E.P.A. was also studying the link between air pollution and the virus or considering policies to address the link, Andrea Woods, a spokeswoman for the agency, referred the question to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and asserted that the Trump administration rollbacks would lead to some air quality improvements.
Beth Gardiner, a journalist and the author of “Choked: Life and Breath in the Age of Air Pollution,” said she was particularly worried about what the coronavirus outbreak would mean for countries with far worse pollution, such as India.
“Most countries don’t take it seriously enough and aren’t doing enough given the scale of the harm that air pollution is doing to all of our health,” she said.
Most fine particulate matter comes from fuel combustion, like automobiles, refineries and power plants, as well as some indoor sources like tobacco smoke.
Breathing in such microscopic pollutants, experts said, inflames and damages the lining of the lungs over time, weakening the body’s ability to fend off respiratory infections.
Multiple studies have found that exposure to fine particulate matter puts people at heightened risk for lung cancer, heart attacks, strokes and even premature death.
In 2003, Dr. Zuo-Feng Zhang, the associate dean for research at the University of California, Los Angeles, Fielding School of Public Health, found that SARS patients in the most polluted parts of China were twice as likely to die from the disease as those in places with low air pollution.
In an interview, Dr. Zhang called the Harvard study “very much consistent” with his findings.
To conduct the Harvard study, researchers collected particulate matter data for the past 17 years from more than 3,000 counties and Covid-19 death counts for each county through April 4 from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center at the Johns Hopkins University.
The resulting model, which examines aggregated rather than individual data, suggested what Dr. Dominici called a statistically significant link between pollution and coronavirus deaths.
The researchers also conducted six secondary analyses to adjust for factors they felt might compromise the results.
For example, because New York state has experienced the most severe coronavirus outbreak in the country and death rates there are five times higher than anywhere else, the researchers repeated the analysis excluding all of the counties in the state.
They also ran the model excluding counties with fewer than 10 confirmed Covid-19 cases.
And they adjusted for various other factors that are known to affect health outcomes, like smoking rates, population density and poverty levels.
Dr. Balmes noted that without studying individual characteristics of patients, the study could only suggest a causal connection between air pollution and Covid-19 deaths and would need to be confirmed by more research — a point with which Dr. Dominici agreed.
But, Dr. Balmes said, “It’s still a valuable finding.

In 2003, Dr. Zuo-Feng Zhang, the associate dean for research at the University of California, Los Angeles, Fielding School of Public Health, found that SARS patients in the most polluted parts of China were twice as likely to die from the disease as those in places with low air pollution.
In an interview, Dr. Zhang called the Harvard study “very much consistent” with his findings.
To conduct the Harvard study, researchers collected particulate matter data for the past 17 years from more than 3,000 counties and Covid-19 death counts for each county through April 4 from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center at the Johns Hopkins University.
The resulting model, which examines aggregated rather than individual data, suggested what Dr. Dominici called a statistically significant link between pollution and coronavirus deaths.
The researchers also conducted six secondary analyses to adjust for factors they felt might compromise the results.
For example, because New York state has experienced the most severe coronavirus outbreak in the country and death rates there are five times higher than anywhere else, the researchers repeated the analysis excluding all of the counties in the state.
They also ran the model excluding counties with fewer than 10 confirmed Covid-19 cases.
And they adjusted for various other factors that are known to affect health outcomes, like smoking rates, population density and poverty levels.
Dr. Balmes noted that without studying individual characteristics of patients, the study could only suggest a causal connection between air pollution and Covid-19 deaths and would need to be confirmed by more research — a point with which Dr. Dominici agreed.
But, Dr. Balmes said, “It’s still a valuable finding.

Jody Wilson-Raybould, who was also the former attorney general, gave the recording to a parliamentary committee that had been looking into her accusations that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his top aides had improperly pressured her over how to handle the case.
She also provided the committee, where she testified last month, with emails, texts and a statement.
Her accusations led to a political crisis for Mr. Trudeau that has dominated news coverage in Canada for the last two months and badly tarnished his image as a feminist who had pledged to bring clean ways to politics.
[Read: How Justin Trudeau Was Ensnared by Scandal: A Corruption Case and ‘Veiled Threats’] In the firestorm, Ms. Wilson-Raybould resigned from the cabinet — where she had been moved to the post of veterans affairs — as did Jane Philpott, another minister, and Gerald Butts, Mr. Trudeau’s close friend and top political adviser.
Michael Wernick, the clerk of the privy council, also resigned his post.
Mr. Trudeau has repeatedly denied that anyone strong-armed Ms. Wilson-Raybould, saying the government was concerned that a criminal conviction for the company would put thousands of Canadian jobs at risk.
He is now preparing his campaign for re-election in October, and has been trying to divert the country’s attention away from the controversy and toward his achievements and plans for the future.
Friday’s release of documents is not likely to help.
In her statement, Ms. Wilson-Raybould, a lawyer who was once a regional chief of First Nations on Canada’s west coast and an advocate for Indigenous rights, commented on how the case has been portrayed in the media.
“A significant part of the public discourse about this matter has touched on issues of race and gender and in particular there have been undeniable elements of misogyny, most of it aimed at myself,” she wrote.
Echoing Mr. Trudeau’s call during the last election for a different approach to politics, Ms. Wilson-Raybould thanked Canadians “who give me hope” and wrote that she looked forward “to acting alongside them in the future — a future where we truly do politics differently.

] In the recording, which is just over 17 minutes long, Mr. Wernick, the clerk of the privy council, told Ms. Wilson-Raybould repeatedly about Mr. Trudeau’s concerns about potential job losses if the company, SNC-Lavalin, was convicted on bribery charges, and then banned from government work.
The company has been charged with bribing Libyan officials during the dictatorship of Col.
Muammar el-Qaddafi, and defrauding the Libyan government.
Mr. Wernick said Mr. Trudeau did not want to do anything illegal or inappropriate, and asked Ms. Wilson-Raybould why she was unwilling to use a new law that could replace a criminal conviction with a hefty monetary penalty.
Ms. Wilson-Raybould warned the clerk about the dangers of the government intervening in the case and issuing orders to prosecutors who are independent of politicians in Canada.
“Does he not understand the gravity of what this potentially could mean?” she asked the clerk, referring to Mr. Trudeau.
“This is not about saving jobs.
This is about interfering with one of our fundamental institutions.
This is like breaching a constitutional principle.
” The recording was made without the clerk’s knowledge, Ms. Wilson-Raybould told the committee in her statement.
This is legal in Canada, but she acknowledged that it was “inappropriate.
” She said that because she took the call at her home in Vancouver, British Columbia, she didn’t have access to a staff member to take notes.
Cameron Ahmad, Mr. Trudeau’s director of communications, said in an email statement Friday night, “We are focused on moving forward as a team on the issues that matter to Canadians and governing in the best interests of the country.
” Last week Mr. Trudeau put new processes in place for how the government handles criminal matters and has ordered a review into splitting the attorney general’s job from that of the justice minister.
But that has not satisfied the opposition Conservative party, which has been trying to keep the controversy alive.
Conservatives have demanded that the justice committee call Ms. Wilson-Raybould back for more testimony, but the committee, dominated by Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal party, has refused.
The Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, has frequently accused Mr. Trudeau of a cover-up.
Mr. Trudeau has been careful not to criticize Ms. Wilson-Raybould or Ms. Philpott, and the two ministers remain as Liberal members of Parliament.
But over the last week, other Liberal caucus members and cabinet ministers have not been so circumspect when it comes to their former colleagues.
Canadians vote for their local members of Parliament, not the political parties or the prime minister.
As a result, the political turmoil Ms. Wilson-Raybould triggered could affect their colleagues’ chances of re-election in this October’s federal election.
The criticisms became more widespread last week after Ms. Philpott told Maclean’s magazine that “there’s much more to the story that needs to be told,” but that it wasn’t coming out because “there’s been an attempt to shut down the story” by Mr. Trudeau and his aides.
But in his statement Friday night, Mr. Ahmad said, “All the facts are on the table now, and everyone involved has shared their perspective, including the prime minister.

60,1913829,"['states are reopening', 'reopening bit', 'bit by bit', 'particles', 'materials tested', 'layered coffee', 'coffee filters']","There is nothing investors hate more than uncertainty.
Right now, that is all there is.
Uncertainty about the severity and duration of the coronavirus outbreak, ripping around the world at something like light speed.
Uncertainty about how the global economy will fare as factories, airports, stores, schools, entire cities shut down.
Uncertainty about the ability of governments to contain the disease and the power of central banks to counter its economic fallout.
Uncertainty about how long all this uncertainty will last.
The spiraling fears have caused financial carnage.
The S&
P 500 index has dropped 12 percent since Feb. 19, the sharpest dive in nine years.
The plunge has obliterated roughly $3 trillion in wealth.
In the past two weeks, even decent days have been tinted with a scary aura.
On Friday afternoon, the S&
P was poised to lose more than 2 percent, before the index pared its losses amid a blizzard of buying in the moments before the closing bell.
(A similar last-minute surge the previous Friday made an awful week a little less bad.
) For all the heartburn-inducing turmoil, the S&
P ended this week essentially flat.
Market records have been falling like dominoes.
The Dow Jones industrial average, for example, had both its biggest single-day point decline (1,191 on Feb. 27) and its biggest gain (1,294 on Monday).
Behind the turbulence are confusion and anxiety, and a sense that the modern world is in an unprecedented situation.
“There’s no playbook for this,” said Derek Devens, a portfolio manager at the fund company Neuberger Berman.
“That’s been really hard for people to digest.
” The financial mayhem extends beyond the stock market.
Many companies are essentially frozen in place, unable to predict how the coronavirus might affect their businesses.
Their immediate task is to figure out how to keep operating while making sure their employees are safe.
In Silicon Valley, Apple and Twitter told people to work from home.
In New York, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase dispatched small parts of their trading desks to the suburbs so they would have backup crews to keep business running in an emergency.
With the global economy now poised to shrink, demand for oil is declining, causing the price of crude to crater.
As investors flee from risk, gold prices have soared.
The safest assets out there — bonds issued by the U.S. government — have shot higher in price.
For the first time, the interest rates on 10-year Treasury note shriveled this week to less than 1 percent, falling on Friday to a record low of 0.71 percent.
A sudden global disease outbreak isn’t the kind of risk that many market players were trained to react to.
Few investors are epidemiologists.
The most sophisticated financial models and the fastest-moving trading algorithms are flying blind.
Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus       newsletter.
“This you can’t even put a model on, because it’s not really something that we’ve seen before,” said Michael Feroli, the chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan.
In financial circles, there’s a term for such events: a black swan.
They are rare but ominous.
And they are impossible to anticipate.
The Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks were a calamitous example, a so-called exogenous shock for markets, having originated outside the financial system itself.
More often, market turmoil comes from within: the mortgage crisis and collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008;
tremors in the junk bond market in 1987 and 1989;
and the demise of the giant Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund in 1998.
In 2001, no one knew if the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were merely the first in a series of strikes.
With the spread of the coronavirus, no one knows how deadly and widespread it will prove to be, or how disruptive to people’s lives, or its impact on the domestic and global economy.
Uncertainty breeds fear, and fear breeds panic.
“Investors went from thinking everything was flawless to hopeless,” said Howard Marks, a co-chairman of the alternative asset manager Oaktree Capital Management.
“People are thinking, ‘I’ll be stepping over bodies on Park Avenue, like the Black Plague.
’ That’s panic.
” Fears can be self-fulfilling.
On Thursday, the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital directed the young tech companies in which it has invested to “question every assumption about your business” and consider taking pre-emptive action to prepare for a downturn, such as curtailing spending and taking a hard look at the size of their workforces.
Sequoia called the coronavirus “the black swan of 2020.” In some respects, exogenous shocks sow even more fear and uncertainty than traditional financial crises, because investors have no experience to draw on.
Monetary policy, and the central banks that wield it, can be effective at battling financial upheavals, as the Federal Reserve managed to do during the 2008 crisis, but it has no effect on viruses.
What is especially unnerving to investors now is the apparent impotence of institutions that would seem to have the greatest chances of soothing markets.
When the Fed announced an emergency decision on Tuesday to slash benchmark interest rates by half a percentage point, stock markets rallied for about 15 minutes before resuming their downward spiral.
One reason: Investors feared that the Fed — whose monetary policy has been a key to the stock market’s long rally — is running out of options to stimulate the economy.
Eric Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said Friday that the central bank might need to weigh new measures to counter a downturn, including buying a wider array of assets.
The reality is that nobody knows quite how to calm markets, much less how to contain the virus outbreak.
Modest bits of upbeat news — the Labor Department announced on Friday morning that the American economy had added 273,000 jobs in February — haven’t done the trick.
“Today you had this great jobs report,” said Jay Foreman, the chief executive of the toy company Basic Fun.
“It’s going to be exactly the opposite next month.
I can’t imagine anybody is hiring anybody this month, unless they’re selling hand sanitizer.
” He said the coronavirus crisis was forcing him to lay off 18 of the company’s 175 workers — 10 in the United States, six in Hong Kong and two in Europe.
Nor were investors soothed by President Trump’s signing of a bill to provide $8.3 billion to fight the coronavirus or cheerful TV assurances from Larry Kudlow, the top White House economic adviser.
“There really isn’t a response from the administration or the authorities telling people to calm down and there’s a plan,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, a strategist at TD Securities in New York.
“It certainly feels like there isn’t a plan, and I feel like that’s what the market’s reacting to.
” That is a recipe for more wild days in the weeks ahead.
In certain Wall Street drugstores, antacid might be in as much demand as hand sanitizer.
“When there’s unprecedented uncertainty, which is what we’re dealing with, we could have elevated volatility for quite some time,” said Julian Emanuel, a strategist at the brokerage firm BTIG.
He noted that Mondays are often days of particular turbulence because investors have spent a couple of days stewing over events.
“What you see in markets, very often these things turn on a weekend,” he said.
However intense, panics don’t last forever.
When markets reopened after the Sept. 11 attacks, the Dow dropped more than 14 percent in a week.
It turned out to be a buying opportunity;
within a month, stocks had recouped their losses.
“There will come a day when we reach a bottom,” said Mr. Marks, the Oaktree co-chairman.
“We have no idea when or where that bottom will be.
But all great investments begin with discomfort.
You make the big money buying things no one else will buy.

Uncertainty about how the global economy will fare as factories, airports, stores, schools, entire cities shut down.
Uncertainty about the ability of governments to contain the disease and the power of central banks to counter its economic fallout.
Uncertainty about how long all this uncertainty will last.
The spiraling fears have caused financial carnage.
The S&
P 500 index has dropped 12 percent since Feb. 19, the sharpest dive in nine years.
The plunge has obliterated roughly $3 trillion in wealth.
In the past two weeks, even decent days have been tinted with a scary aura.
On Friday afternoon, the S&
P was poised to lose more than 2 percent, before the index pared its losses amid a blizzard of buying in the moments before the closing bell.
(A similar last-minute surge the previous Friday made an awful week a little less bad.
) For all the heartburn-inducing turmoil, the S&
P ended this week essentially flat.
Market records have been falling like dominoes.
The Dow Jones industrial average, for example, had both its biggest single-day point decline (1,191 on Feb. 27) and its biggest gain (1,294 on Monday).
Behind the turbulence are confusion and anxiety, and a sense that the modern world is in an unprecedented situation.
“There’s no playbook for this,” said Derek Devens, a portfolio manager at the fund company Neuberger Berman.
“That’s been really hard for people to digest.
” The financial mayhem extends beyond the stock market.
Many companies are essentially frozen in place, unable to predict how the coronavirus might affect their businesses.
Their immediate task is to figure out how to keep operating while making sure their employees are safe.
In Silicon Valley, Apple and Twitter told people to work from home.
In New York, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase dispatched small parts of their trading desks to the suburbs so they would have backup crews to keep business running in an emergency.
With the global economy now poised to shrink, demand for oil is declining, causing the price of crude to crater.
As investors flee from risk, gold prices have soared.
The safest assets out there — bonds issued by the U.S. government — have shot higher in price.
For the first time, the interest rates on 10-year Treasury note shriveled this week to less than 1 percent, falling on Friday to a record low of 0.71 percent.
A sudden global disease outbreak isn’t the kind of risk that many market players were trained to react to.
Few investors are epidemiologists.
The most sophisticated financial models and the fastest-moving trading algorithms are flying blind.
“This you can’t even put a model on, because it’s not really something that we’ve seen before,” said Michael Feroli, the chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan.
In financial circles, there’s a term for such events: a black swan.
They are rare but ominous.
And they are impossible to anticipate.
The Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks were a calamitous example, a so-called exogenous shock for markets, having originated outside the financial system itself.
More often, market turmoil comes from within: the mortgage crisis and collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008;
tremors in the junk bond market in 1987 and 1989;
and the demise of the giant Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund in 1998.
In 2001, no one knew if the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were merely the first in a series of strikes.
With the spread of the coronavirus, no one knows how deadly and widespread it will prove to be, or how disruptive to people’s lives, or its impact on the domestic and global economy.
Uncertainty breeds fear, and fear breeds panic.
“Investors went from thinking everything was flawless to hopeless,” said Howard Marks, a co-chairman of the alternative asset manager Oaktree Capital Management.
“People are thinking, ‘I’ll be stepping over bodies on Park Avenue, like the Black Plague.
’ That’s panic.
” Fears can be self-fulfilling.
On Thursday, the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital directed the young tech companies in which it has invested to “question every assumption about your business” and consider taking pre-emptive action to prepare for a downturn, such as curtailing spending and taking a hard look at the size of their workforces.
Sequoia called the coronavirus “the black swan of 2020.” In some respects, exogenous shocks sow even more fear and uncertainty than traditional financial crises, because investors have no experience to draw on.
Monetary policy, and the central banks that wield it, can be effective at battling financial upheavals, as the Federal Reserve managed to do during the 2008 crisis, but it has no effect on viruses.
What is especially unnerving to investors now is the apparent impotence of institutions that would seem to have the greatest chances of soothing markets.
When the Fed announced an emergency decision on Tuesday to slash benchmark interest rates by half a percentage point, stock markets rallied for about 15 minutes before resuming their downward spiral.
One reason: Investors feared that the Fed — whose monetary policy has been a key to the stock market’s long rally — is running out of options to stimulate the economy.
Eric Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said Friday that the central bank might need to weigh new measures to counter a downturn, including buying a wider array of assets.
Updated June 30, 2020 Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.
Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common.
The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for.
Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.
Scientists around the country have tried to identify everyday materials that do a good job of filtering microscopic particles.
In recent tests, HEPA furnace filters scored high, as did vacuum cleaner bags, fabric similar to flannel pajamas and those of 600-count pillowcases.
Other materials tested included layered coffee filters and scarves and bandannas.
These scored lower, but still captured a small percentage of particles.
A commentary published this month on the website of the British Journal of Sports Medicine points out that covering your face during exercise “comes with issues of potential breathing restriction and discomfort” and requires “balancing benefits versus possible adverse events.
” Masks do alter exercise, says Cedric X. Bryant, the president and chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise, a nonprofit organization that funds exercise research and certifies fitness professionals.
“In my personal experience,” he says, “heart rates are higher at the same relative intensity when you wear a mask.
” Some people also could experience lightheadedness during familiar workouts while masked, says Len Kravitz, a professor of exercise science at the University of New Mexico.
The steroid, dexamethasone, is the first treatment shown to reduce mortality in severely ill patients, according to scientists in Britain.
The drug appears to reduce inflammation caused by the immune system, protecting the tissues.
In the study, dexamethasone reduced deaths of patients on ventilators by one-third, and deaths of patients on oxygen by one-fifth.
The coronavirus emergency relief package gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the virus.
It gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking diagnosis or preventive care for coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members.
It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus.
It is the first time the United States has had widespread federally mandated paid leave, and includes people who don’t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers.
But the measure excludes at least half of private-sector workers, including those at the country’s largest employers, and gives small employers significant leeway to deny leave.
So far, the evidence seems to show it does.
A widely cited paper published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was “very rare,”  but she later walked back that statement.
Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads.
But it can happen.
A number of studies of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and hospitals.
But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way.
The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks.
A study by European scientists is the first to document a strong statistical link between genetic variations and Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.
Having Type A blood was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study.
The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected.
Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14.7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II.
But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April.
If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself.
Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face.
If possible, choose a window seat.
A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people.
Disinfect hard surfaces.
When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table.
If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too.
(Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor.
They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.
The reality is that nobody knows quite how to calm markets, much less how to contain the virus outbreak.
Modest bits of upbeat news — the Labor Department announced on Friday morning that the American economy had added 273,000 jobs in February — haven’t done the trick.
“Today you had this great jobs report,” said Jay Foreman, the chief executive of the toy company Basic Fun.
“It’s going to be exactly the opposite next month.
I can’t imagine anybody is hiring anybody this month, unless they’re selling hand sanitizer.
” He said the coronavirus crisis was forcing him to lay off 18 of the company’s 175 workers — 10 in the United States, six in Hong Kong and two in Europe.
Nor were investors soothed by President Trump’s signing of a bill to provide $8.3 billion to fight the coronavirus or cheerful TV assurances from Larry Kudlow, the top White House economic adviser.
“There really isn’t a response from the administration or the authorities telling people to calm down and there’s a plan,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, a strategist at TD Securities in New York.
“It certainly feels like there isn’t a plan, and I feel like that’s what the market’s reacting to.
” That is a recipe for more wild days in the weeks ahead.
In certain Wall Street drugstores, antacid might be in as much demand as hand sanitizer.
“When there’s unprecedented uncertainty, which is what we’re dealing with, we could have elevated volatility for quite some time,” said Julian Emanuel, a strategist at the brokerage firm BTIG.
He noted that Mondays are often days of particular turbulence because investors have spent a couple of days stewing over events.
“What you see in markets, very often these things turn on a weekend,” he said.
However intense, panics don’t last forever.
When markets reopened after the Sept. 11 attacks, the Dow dropped more than 14 percent in a week.
It turned out to be a buying opportunity;
within a month, stocks had recouped their losses.
“There will come a day when we reach a bottom,” said Mr. Marks, the Oaktree co-chairman.
“We have no idea when or where that bottom will be.
But all great investments begin with discomfort.
You make the big money buying things no one else will buy.

61,1784584,"['Mr. Gandhi', 'Mr. modi', 'parliament', 'votes', 'Hail modi!', 'fake exit', 'exit polls', 'united states']","Prime Minister Narendra Modi, one of the most powerful and divisive leaders India has produced in decades, appeared headed for another five-year term, according to exit polls released on Sunday that showed his party heavily leading.
According to all of the major exit polls, Mr. Modi’s brand of Hindu nationalist politics, coupled with his efforts to project a strong image of India abroad, played well among the country’s 900 million registered voters.
At least seven exit polls released by Indian news organizations on Sunday night predicted that Mr. Modi’s party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., and its allies would win at least 280 of the 545 seats in the lower house of Parliament, empowering them to choose the next prime minister.
If the actual results back the polls up, it will be a more dominating performance than many analysts had thought possible a few months ago, when Mr. Modi appeared to be struggling on economic issues.
[Read about the drama and dynamics that unfolded during the 2019 elections in India.] The election turnout was one for the history books — the largest exercise of democracy ever.
In seven phases over 39 days, hundreds of millions of voters cast ballots nationwide at a million polling stations, spread across densely populated megacities and far-flung villages.
Turnout percentage also reached a record high, with more than 67 percent of eligible voters participating.
It is a feat of gargantuan proportions, requiring 12 million polling officials and cutting-edge technology.
At least 22 opposition parties, including the Congress party, petitioned the Election Commission to audit results before the final count is released on Thursday.
They said voting machines had been rigged to favor the B.J.P.
The election body ultimately rejected their request on Wednesday.
The leader of the Congress party, Rahul Gandhi, expressed skepticism of the Election Commission on his Twitter account.
As the election came to a close, dozens of fake exit polls attributed to news organizations like The New York Times and the BBC also circulated on WhatsApp.
A majority of them predicted a landslide victory for the B.J.P.
Mr. Gandhi issued a statement telling party workers to stay “alert” and “vigilant.
” “Do not be disheartened by the propaganda of fake exit polls,” he tweeted.
The Indian elections are a massive democratic feat.
But things are never seamless, and this year the elections did include incidents of violence (though fewer than in previous years) and complaints about rigging, booth capturing and mishandling of electronic voting machines.
[Read how simmering hostility between rival parties — and Hindus and Muslims — erupted into violence in a West Bengal town.
] This week, around 500 masked men armed with sticks, machetes and rifles attacked a group of polling officials in the remote northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh.
The Indian news media reported that the assailants belonged to a party affiliated with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.
The attackers fired at the officials.
It is unclear if anybody was injured.
In Faridabad, near Delhi, an election official was arrested after video surfaced on social media of him trying to influence voters.
In Meerut, a northern Indian city, a group of men set up tents and passed out binoculars to keep an round-the-clock watch on voting machine storage rooms.
India’s Election Commission said it had seized nearly $500 million worth of cash, drugs, liquor and precious metals this election, far more than in 2014.
Exit polls suggested that India’s once-dominant powerhouse of a political party, the Indian National Congress, would not be returning to its old glory anytime soon.
Any gains the Congress party does make are likely to be because of disappointment in Mr. Modi’s economic policies.
Farmers have suffered, and Mr. Modi has struggled to create jobs as unemployment rates have risen.
His time in office has also been marked by the rise of Hindu nationalism threatening the diverse nation’s fragile fault lines.
The Congress party has long cast itself as embracing India’s diverse population, particularly Muslims and other minority groups that Mr. Modi’s party continues to alienate.
The party is led by Rahul Gandhi, 48, the scion of the country’s most famous political dynasty.
His great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the first prime minister of independent India.
Both his grandmother, Indira Gandhi, and his father, Rajiv Gandhi, served as prime ministers and were assassinated.

","[Read about how Narendra Modi scored a historic election victory.] In a thundering speech to party workers outside the B.J.P.’s headquarters in New Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi struck a humble tone.
“I bow to the 1.3 billion people of India,” he said.
“If someone is victorious, it is India,” he said.
“If someone is victorious, it is democracy.
If someone is victorious, it is the electorate.
” Striking a populist tone and evoking mythical Hindu figures engaged in war, Mr. Modi framed the elections as a victory by and for ordinary Indians, over those who write off the poor and downtrodden.
At the end of the battle, he said, was “the guarantee of a bright future for India.
” “Some are saying, ‘Modi, Modi, Modi.
’” he said.
“This is not Modi’s victory.
This is the victory of the expectations of the honest citizen of this country.
” “This is the victory of the mother who was longing for a toilet,” he continued.
“This victory is of the farmers who sweat to fill the stomachs of others.
This is the victory of the 400 million unorganized laborers.
” Mr. Modi, one of the most powerful and divisive leaders India has produced in decades, appeared easily headed for another five-year term, according to election returns.
With most votes counted, the Election Commission reported that Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., was ahead in about 299 parliamentary districts, far beyond the 272 seats it would need for a majority in the 543-seat Parliament.
At this pace, the party would actually expand on its current majority — a development no one was predicting in recent months.
And its actual majority will be larger, as its established coalition partners have won at least a few dozen more seats.
The main opposition Congress Party was ahead in 49 seats, according to Election Commission data.
Before the election, most analysts predicted that the B.J.P. would lose seats overall, mostly because of dissatisfaction with the economy.
But that was before tensions with Pakistan handed Mr. Modi an issue he could command.
He campaigned heavily on national security and on a forceful foreign policy, and it's now clear that played well among India’s 900 million registered voters.
Rahul Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress Party, conceded defeat on Thursday after it was clear that Mr. Modi’s party had swept the election.
“I said during the campaign that the people were the masters, and today they have given their verdict,” Mr. Gandhi said at a brief news conference from Congress headquarters in New Delhi.
“We concede in this election that Narendra Modi and the B.J.P. have won.
” So crushing was the defeat of Congress that even Mr. Gandhi, the scion of India’s most famous political dynasty, lost his seat in Amethi in Uttar Pradesh.
Mr. Gandhi said it was not the right time to discuss why Congress had lost.
“Today is the day that a new prime minister has been elected, and today is the day to wish him the best, and hopefully he will look after the interests of the country,” he said.
The grandson and great-grandson of two Indian prime ministers, Mr. Gandhi lost the seat in Amethi that his family had held for decades.
“She has won,” he said of Smriti Irani, the B.J.P. minister who defeated him.
(Mr. Gandhi will remain in Parliament, having won a second seat he contested in Wayanad, Kerala.) Mr. Gandhi, whom many criticized as too soft to lead India, said he responded to attacks on him during the campaign with love.
“Love never loses,” he said.
In Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s small inner circle, the B.J.P.’s president, Amit Shah, is perhaps his closest confidante.
And outside of Mr. Modi himself, Mr. Shah is the party operative whom most credit with helping to engineer this victory.
For much of the election campaign, Mr. Shah, 54, a Hindu hard-liner who is projected to win a parliamentary seat in the state of Gujarat, focused his attention on the state of West Bengal, home to many of India’s Muslims.
And his rhetoric has been bluntly anti-Muslim.
In countless speeches there, he painted his rivals as soft on illegal immigration from Muslim-majority Bangladesh, which borders West Bengal.
He accused opposition politicians of funding Islamic schools that jeopardized India’s Hindus.
Mr. Shah, who some analysts believe is in line to become home minister, vowed to remove every “single infiltrator from the country, except Buddhists, Hindus and Sikhs.
” In another apparent swipe at Muslims, he called immigrants “termites.
” Mr. Shah also mocked Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the Congress Party, for running in a Muslim-dominated part of the southern state of Kerala.
“When a procession is taken out there, it is difficult to make out whether it is an Indian or a Pakistani procession,” he said, suggesting that Muslims were not Indian citizens.
The Bharatiya Janata Party gained ground in some states that have been hostile to the party, according to the results released so far.
For example, in West Bengal, where politics is dominated by the Trinamool Congress party and its chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, the B.J.P. appears to have won 18 seats.
That’s nearly half the total seats in the state, where it won just two last election.
Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah, the head of the B.J.P., visited the state several times.
They accused Ms. Banerjee of corruption and “appeasement” of the state’s Muslims, who make up about a quarter of the population.
Mr. Modi’s party also made big gains in Karnataka, home to the technology hub of Bangalore, where it narrowly lost the state assembly elections last year to a coalition of the Congress Party and the local J.D.S.
The B.J.P. captured nearly all of the parliamentary seats, a result that could lead to the collapse of the current state government.
One bright spot for Congress in an otherwise dismal showing was its performance in Kerala.
Voters in the southern coastal state have long backed the Communists and allied parties, but a coalition led by the Congress captured nearly all of the seats this time.
Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the Congress Party, is running for a seat in Wayanad, Kerala, which he is expected to win even if he loses his current seat in Amethi, Uttar Pradesh.
The number of Muslims in Parliament is expected to fall to a historic low, a function of B.J.P’s dominance and antipathy to running Muslim candidates.
Since Mr. Modi and his Hindu nationalist supporters rose to power, Indian Muslims say violence against them has risen.
Before Thursday’s vote count, Muslims held just 24 seats in Parliament, about 4.4 percent of the total, and the fewest the community has held since 1952.
In Uttar Pradesh, the country’s largest state and home to 43 million Muslims, not a single Muslim candidate was elected to the Indian Parliament.
And the B.J.P. there did not field any Muslim candidates this year.
The party is led in the state by Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu nationalist who has been accused of organizing religious riots.
Aftab Syed, 33, a student at Aligarh Muslim University in Uttar Pradesh, said the election’s outcome was troubling.
“The very idea of keeping Muslims out of Parliament means you want to disempower them,” he said.
There were few candidates more divisive — or more talked about — than Sadhvi Pragya Thakur, a member of the B.J.P. who is likely to win a parliamentary seat in central India.
Ms. Thakur is awaiting trial in a 2008 terrorism attack.
Prosecutors believe Ms. Thakur and other Hindu extremists blew up a motorcycle that killed six people in a Muslim-majority city in the state of Maharashtra.
On the campaign trail, Ms. Thakur, 49, who is running for a seat in the city of Bhopal, created waves.
She claimed she beat breast cancer by drinking cows’ urine, and called Mohandas Gandhi’s assassin a “patriot.
” Even Mr. Modi, a Hindu nationalist and the leader of B.J.P.,  distanced himself from Ms. Thakur’s comments about the assassin, saying he would “never be able to forgive her fully.
” Neelanjan Sircar, a senior visiting fellow at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi, said Ms. Thakur’s candidacy was intended to send a message to the B.J.P.’s “very hard-core Hindu nationalist base.
” “They want to say, ‘We’re still on your side,’ ” he said.
Hundreds of people with ties to India gathered in Edison, N. J.
, on Wednesday night to watch the initial election results trickle in, and celebrate a potential win for Mr. Modi, a leader whom many see as strengthening India’s image in the world.
The crowd, a mix of expatriates and American citizens, posed for selfies with a cardboard cutout of the prime minister, and cheered each time results favoring Mr. Modi’s B.J.P. were announced.
“There’s a more heightened interest this year,” said Krishna Reddy Anugula, 50, president of Overseas Friends of the B.J.P.
The organization has about 4,000 members across the United States.
“People saw that this is a leader who is doing good for the country,” said Mr. Reddy, citing Mr. Modi’s economic proposals and pledges to improve the lives of the poor.
Indian-Americans — a population of about 4 million — cannot vote in the election unless they still retain their Indian citizenship.
Then, too, citizens must be in India to cast their ballots.
Yet many Indians in America have sought to participate by organizing rallies, and calling friends and family members in India to encourage them to vote.
“Let’s elect them for five more years and see what they do,” Mr. Reddy said of the B.J.P.
As the early results suggested a strong victory for Mr. Modi and the B.J.P., India’s stock market rose 2 percent to an all-time high.
Mr. Modi is viewed as good for business.
He has simplified the tax system and cut down on corruption, and one of the signature achievements of his term was an overhaul of the country’s corporate bankruptcy system.
India’s stock market has been a bright spot in Asia, particularly as Chinese shares have suffered amid that country’s escalating trade war with the United States.
“For the markets, it’s like a vote of relief,” Jyoti Jaipuria, founder of Valentis Advisors, an investment advisory firm in Mumbai, said earlier this week, when exit polls showed that Mr. Modi’s party was likely to win again.
“Politics is out of the way, and everybody can be back to fundamentals.
” As news of Mr. Modi’s impending win picked up in India, Pakistan’s powerful military establishment announced on Thursday that it had successfully test-fired a Shaheen II ballistic missile, which is capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
The two countries went to the brink of war this year after a terrorist attack killed Indian soldiers in the disputed territory of Kashmir — in a surge of tensions that many political analysts believe helped Mr. Modi’s showing in the election.
But Pakistan is not the only one of the nuclear-armed neighbors to use missiles to make a point.
After the two countries’ showdown over Kashmir — and just two weeks before Indian elections were to begin — Mr. Modi announced that India had successfully used a missile to shoot down an old satellite.
That test made it just the fourth country in the world to have that kind of antisatellite capability.

62,1914884,"['paid leave', 'regular exercise', 'social distancing', 'hand washing', 'political leaders', 'masks']","As hospitals around the country prepare for an influx of highly infectious coronavirus cases, their supplies of a crucial type of respirator mask are dwindling fast.
“We’re not willing to run out of N95 masks,” Dr. Susan Ray, an infectious disease specialist at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, said in a phone interview, referring to the masks by their technical name.
“That’s not O.K. at my hospital.
” At some point she may have no choice.
Grady executives said on Monday that the hospital had a little more than a month’s supply of N95 masks;
they did not immediately explain whether that estimate was based on normal levels of use or accounted for a possible spike in need.
With global supplies already depleted from the outbreak in China and manufacturers facing an explosion of new orders as the virus spreads, some hospitals in the United States have been unable to get new shipments of N95 masks or even an estimate of when they might become available.
“I can tell you my other colleagues across our multiple hospitals are really rationing,” said Dr. Ray.
N95 masks are tighter fitting and thicker than surgical masks.
While surgical masks can block only large-particle droplets, N95 masks filter out 95 percent of all airborne particles when used correctly.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that they be used only by people with infectious respiratory illness and health care workers who treat or otherwise come in contact with them.
“It’s not just about the patients identified as having the virus,” said Dr. Wendy Armstrong, another infectious disease specialist at Grady, who is more accustomed to using N95 masks to evaluate patients who might have tuberculosis.
“It’s also about the people you are evaluating to rule out the virus, and the testing is not instant.
” Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus       newsletter.
Protecting health care workers from the virus is essential to managing the epidemic, to ensure hospitals, urgent care centers and other facilities can handle inevitable surges in sick patients.
A number of doctors and nurses around the country have already been quarantined for two weeks after patients they interacted with tested positive for the virus;
health care workers in China have gotten sick and even died amid extreme shortages of masks and other protective gear.
The federal government’s Strategic National Stockpile of medical supplies includes 12 million medical-grade N95 masks and 30 million surgical masks — only about one percent of the 3.5 billion that the Department of Health and Human Services estimates would be needed over the course of a year if the outbreak reaches pandemic levels.
The department announced last week that the federal government had put in a guaranteed order for 500 million N95 masks over the next 18 months, a move it said would encourage manufacturers “to immediately increase production of N95s for use by health care professionals.
” A spokeswoman for the health and human services department said the first step for hospitals experiencing shortages was to ask their local or state public health department, many of which have their own emergency supplies.
“If the state is unable to provide supplies, state health officials — through the governor or his or her representative — may request federal assistance from the Department of Health and Human Services,” the spokeswoman said.
“We are working with industry partners and soliciting information about their capacity to produce masks and other protective equipment so we can rapidly arrange contracts to buy supplies to protect the American people.
” The Washington State Department of Health told health care providers last week it would start following World Health Organization guidelines, which say that surgical masks, which protect against droplets but do not form a seal around the face, should be used except when performing ”aerosol-generating procedures” like intubation.
The hospital shortages stem not only from global supplies being depleted after the prolonged outbreak in China but also because of widespread panic-buying of masks by anxious citizens here and abroad.
Most hospitals don’t keep a large supply on hand, because they are not in the practice of buying far more than they need at any given time.
Tony Morain, vice president of communications at Direct Relief, a humanitarian aid organization in Santa Barbara, Calif.
, said the group had become so frustrated by shortages even before the virus outbreak that it had contracted with a company in China to start manufacturing its own supply.
Direct Relief had two million N95 masks on hand in early January, Mr. Morain said, anticipating another busy wildfire season in the western states this summer.
Then the Australian wildfires happened, and the group sent a few hundred thousand masks there.
When the Chinese outbreak escalated, Direct Relief sent most of its remaining stock there.
“Now we are receiving quite a few requests from health centers around the country and our supply stands at about 500,000 N95 masks,” Mr. Morain said, adding, “In the coming days, we will start apportioning them out to areas where health workers are at extreme risk of exposure.
” At Highland Hospital in Oakland, Calif.
, emergency room physicians said they had been dipping into reserves and hoping that the state of emergency that Gov.
Gavin Newsom declared last week would allow them to access whatever supply the state had on hand.
Lindsay Caulfield, a senior vice president at Grady Health, said Monday morning that the system had “over a 35 day supply” of N95 masks, adding, “We buy the maximum amount allowed to us each week” from the manufacturer Grady contracts with.
Spokespeople for several other large hospital systems contacted last week — including IU Health in Indianapolis, Jackson Health in Miami, the University of Vermont Medical Center and the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation — said in carefully worded statements that they had a sufficient supply of N95 masks for now.
“In anticipation of possible supply chain disruptions in the coming months, we are implementing steps to preserve personal protective equipment while maintaining all clinical guidelines and protocols,” said Alyscia Grant, a spokeswoman for Care New England, a nonprofit system with several hospitals in Rhode Island.
The Food and Drug Administration last week granted a request from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to allow health care workers to use similar respirator masks approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health — not currently regulated by the F.D.A., and typically used in construction and manufacturing — during the coronavirus outbreak.
The C.D.C. has also said that if shortages worsen during an outbreak, N95 masks can be used for “repeated close contact encounters with several patients” instead of being thrown away after one encounter, as well as beyond their manufacturer-designated shelf life.
If no respirators are left, the newly updated C.D.C. guidance says, health care providers who are older, have chronic medical conditions or are pregnant should avoid treating patients with Covid-19.
Providers who have already had the disease, “who may have some protective immunity,” should be the first to treat them if no masks are available.
Dr. Ray of Grady Hospital said doctors there and at a number of other hospitals she had been in contact with were also concerned about running low on regular medical masks, to the point where Grady, one of the nation’s largest and busiest public hospitals, had made them harder to access.
“Health care workers, visitors — if someone sees masks, they are grabbing and taking them,” she said.
Under the new rules, she said, “If people need them, they’ll have to ask.
” Doctors who see a lot of sick patients in their offices, rather than a hospital, are increasingly anxious, too.
One physician at an outpatient center that is part of the N.Y.U.
Langone Health System, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely, said, “We don’t have N95 masks, and are being asked to see patients with surgical masks instead.
We are considering refusing to see potential Covid patients unless we have proper protection.
” (“Covid” refers to the name of the disease caused by the virus, Covid-19.) Dr. Marc Habert, a pediatrician in Fishkill, N.Y., said the group he works for, with eight offices in three counties, had virtually no N95 masks or other protective equipment on hand.
“We can’t get any.
Everything’s back-ordered,” he said.
“I was on a phone call earlier with the local department of health and they basically said the state has supplies, but we need to show we tried to order from three separate places first.
” Georgia had six confirmed cases of coronavirus as of Monday afternoon, including a teacher in the Atlanta area, which led to a decision to close public schools in Fulton County on Tuesday for deep cleaning.
Nobody with the virus has been treated at Grady so far, but Dr. Ray said the hospital recently saw one suspected case that proved negative for the virus after several days during which workers went through a lot of personal protective equipment.
“Right now we are just anticipating that we are going to have a lot of patients,” Dr. Ray said, “and we aren’t going to have enough supplies if we don’t figure out how to use less.
”
","As hospitals around the country prepare for an influx of highly infectious coronavirus cases, their supplies of a crucial type of respirator mask are dwindling fast.
“We’re not willing to run out of N95 masks,” Dr. Susan Ray, an infectious disease specialist at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, said in a phone interview, referring to the masks by their technical name.
“That’s not O.K. at my hospital.
” At some point she may have no choice.
Grady executives said on Monday that the hospital had a little more than a month’s supply of N95 masks;
they did not immediately explain whether that estimate was based on normal levels of use or accounted for a possible spike in need.
With global supplies already depleted from the outbreak in China and manufacturers facing an explosion of new orders as the virus spreads, some hospitals in the United States have been unable to get new shipments of N95 masks or even an estimate of when they might become available.
“I can tell you my other colleagues across our multiple hospitals are really rationing,” said Dr. Ray.
N95 masks are tighter fitting and thicker than surgical masks.
While surgical masks can block only large-particle droplets, N95 masks filter out 95 percent of all airborne particles when used correctly.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that they be used only by people with infectious respiratory illness and health care workers who treat or otherwise come in contact with them.
“It’s not just about the patients identified as having the virus,” said Dr. Wendy Armstrong, another infectious disease specialist at Grady, who is more accustomed to using N95 masks to evaluate patients who might have tuberculosis.
“It’s also about the people you are evaluating to rule out the virus, and the testing is not instant.
” Protecting health care workers from the virus is essential to managing the epidemic, to ensure hospitals, urgent care centers and other facilities can handle inevitable surges in sick patients.
A number of doctors and nurses around the country have already been quarantined for two weeks after patients they interacted with tested positive for the virus;
health care workers in China have gotten sick and even died amid extreme shortages of masks and other protective gear.
The federal government’s Strategic National Stockpile of medical supplies includes 12 million medical-grade N95 masks and 30 million surgical masks — only about one percent of the 3.5 billion that the Department of Health and Human Services estimates would be needed over the course of a year if the outbreak reaches pandemic levels.
The department announced last week that the federal government had put in a guaranteed order for 500 million N95 masks over the next 18 months, a move it said would encourage manufacturers “to immediately increase production of N95s for use by health care professionals.
” A spokeswoman for the health and human services department said the first step for hospitals experiencing shortages was to ask their local or state public health department, many of which have their own emergency supplies.
“If the state is unable to provide supplies, state health officials — through the governor or his or her representative — may request federal assistance from the Department of Health and Human Services,” the spokeswoman said.
“We are working with industry partners and soliciting information about their capacity to produce masks and other protective equipment so we can rapidly arrange contracts to buy supplies to protect the American people.
” The Washington State Department of Health told health care providers last week it would start following World Health Organization guidelines, which say that surgical masks, which protect against droplets but do not form a seal around the face, should be used except when performing ”aerosol-generating procedures” like intubation.
The hospital shortages stem not only from global supplies being depleted after the prolonged outbreak in China but also because of widespread panic-buying of masks by anxious citizens here and abroad.
Most hospitals don’t keep a large supply on hand, because they are not in the practice of buying far more than they need at any given time.
Tony Morain, vice president of communications at Direct Relief, a humanitarian aid organization in Santa Barbara, Calif.
, said the group had become so frustrated by shortages even before the virus outbreak that it had contracted with a company in China to start manufacturing its own supply.
Direct Relief had two million N95 masks on hand in early January, Mr. Morain said, anticipating another busy wildfire season in the western states this summer.
Then the Australian wildfires happened, and the group sent a few hundred thousand masks there.
When the Chinese outbreak escalated, Direct Relief sent most of its remaining stock there.
“Now we are receiving quite a few requests from health centers around the country and our supply stands at about 500,000 N95 masks,” Mr. Morain said, adding, “In the coming days, we will start apportioning them out to areas where health workers are at extreme risk of exposure.
” At Highland Hospital in Oakland, Calif.
, emergency room physicians said they had been dipping into reserves and hoping that the state of emergency that Gov.
Gavin Newsom declared last week would allow them to access whatever supply the state had on hand.

63,1802254,"['Mr. Buttigieg', 'Mr. Obama', 'Silicon Valley', 'fund-raising', 'second quarter']","WASHINGTON — Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.
, raised $24.8 million over the past three months, his campaign said on Monday, a head-turning total that is likely to be among the largest disclosed by any of the Democratic presidential candidates for the second quarter of the year.
Mr. Buttigieg’s haul, from more than 294,000 donors, is the clearest indicator yet of how a candidate who only months ago was little known among voters has become a formidable contender in the race for the Democratic nomination.
His strong fund-raising gives him the financial resources to build a robust campaign operation and compete with rivals who entered the race as far better-known figures, such as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is also expected to report a big fund-raising total for the quarter.
[Here’s the latest data on who’s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.
] Mr. Buttigieg had more than 230,000 new donors in the quarter, bringing his total number of donors during his presidential bid to more than 400,000, his campaign said.
The average contribution over the course of his campaign has been $47.42, according to his team.
His campaign said it now had more than $22.6 million in cash on hand.
“This fundraising report shows that Pete’s message is resonating with Americans, and it’s proof that we are building an organization that can compete,” Mike Schmuhl, his campaign manager, said in an early-morning email to supporters announcing the fund-raising total.
Mr. Buttigieg’s total for the most recent quarter is more than three times the $7.1 million that he raised in the first quarter of 2019 — which itself was an attention-grabbing figure that offered early evidence that his candidacy was catching on.
His total in the first quarter ranked fourth in the Democratic field, behind Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, with $18.2 million;
Senator Kamala Harris of California, with $12 million;
and former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas, with $9.4 million.
(Mr. Biden had not yet entered the race.) Mr. Buttigieg is the first Democratic candidate to announce his fund-raising total for the second quarter.
Other candidates will most likely publicize their numbers in the coming days, and all of them are required to report their fund-raising to the Federal Election Commission by July
15. Like other campaigns, Mr. Buttigieg’s campaign emailed supporters on Sunday seeking donations and emphasizing the deadline for the end of the quarter, which ran from April through June.
“There are countless primary voters who are leaning our way but are waiting to see us demonstrate that we can actually fund and build an organization before they commit their support,” Mr. Buttigieg wrote in one email.
Mr. Buttigieg’s haul for the quarter came from traditional fund-raising events with wealthy donors, low-dollar “grass-roots” fund-raisers and online donations.
He has been notably aggressive in raising money on the traditional fund-raising circuit, but he has also shown success at pulling in smaller contributions online.
[Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] In the first quarter of the year, 64 percent of his money came from donors giving $200 or less — a larger share than most of his rivals raised from small donors.
Mr. Buttigieg’s strong fund-raising gives him ample resources to compete in the Democratic primary race, though it is hardly a guarantee of success.
Mr. Buttigieg has polled well enough to place him in the upper tier of candidates in the large Democratic field, but he remains in single digits in national polling.
And although he is now much better known, he still faces a big challenge in growing his support with black voters, a critical constituency in the party.
He has recently been confronted by a local crisis, the fatal shooting of a black man by a white police officer in South Bend, which has tested his leadership and revived scrutiny of his handling of the police department and his relationship with black residents.
","WASHINGTON — When Pete Buttigieg’s top fund-raisers gathered in Miami Beach to watch the first Democratic debate last week, those in attendance included corporate executives, Chelsea Clinton’s wedding planner and a 19-year-old who had started a viral Facebook page supporting the South Bend, Ind.
, mayor’s presidential campaign.
It was a diverse group of supporters, but not a surprising one for Mr. Buttigieg.
Through the first two fund-raising quarters, no other Democratic presidential candidate has married traditional high-dollar fund-raising with online small donations as successfully as Mr. Buttigieg, whose campaign announced on Monday that he had collected $24.8 million from more than 294,000 donors for the three-month period ending Sunday.
While former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has tapped into the party’s major donors, and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have staked their candidacies on grass-roots support, Mr. Buttigieg has risen to the top tier by doing both, after beginning his campaign virtually unknown outside of Indiana.
His second-quarter total is likely to surpass every one of his rivals except perhaps for Mr. Biden, according to officials briefed on the candidates’ fund-raising efforts.
Mr. Buttigieg’s fund-raising haul indicates he has moved beyond the circle of L.G.B.T. donors who, early in the race, powered his bid as the first gay major presidential candidate.
He has put together a wide-ranging donor base that looks more like the one Barack Obama used when he stunned observers by keeping pace with and then eclipsing Hillary Clinton’s fund-raising at the outset of the 2008 campaign.
“They’ve got a badass operation,” Rufus Gifford, the finance director for Mr. Obama’s re-election campaign, said of Mr. Buttigieg’s campaign.
During the second quarter, Mr. Buttigieg attended about 50 high-dollar fund-raising events, for which ticket prices typically run $2,800, the maximum individual contribution allowed by federal law in the primary.
But he also held 20 “grass-roots” fund-raising events, for which ticket prices start as low as $15.
And from March 24 to June 22, the Buttigieg campaign’s combined spending on digital advertising on Facebook and Google ($1.3 million) exceeded that of any other candidate except Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, according to Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic digital communications firm.
[Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Mr. Buttigieg has wooed tech executives in Silicon Valley and, as a former Navy reservist in Afghanistan, has courted military veterans.
He is also popular among educated liberals on the coasts;
this weekend he will hold fund-raisers on Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket.
Despite his success, Mr. Buttigieg’s strategy presents some challenges.
Accepting Silicon Valley money has become controversial at a time when big tech companies are under siege for lapses with privacy and misinformation.
And his popularity with wealthy white liberals is great for fund-raising but so far has not helped him win much support from people of color, without whom no candidate can survive key early-primary contests in the South and West.
He still faces a big challenge in growing his support with black voters, a critical constituency.
He has recently been confronted by a local crisis, the fatal shooting of a black man by a white police officer in South Bend, which has tested his leadership.
Mr. Buttigieg had more than 230,000 new donors in the second quarter, bringing his total to more than 400,000, his campaign said.
The average contribution over the course of his campaign has been $47.42, according to his team.
His campaign said it now had more than $22.6 million in cash on hand.
Of that, $832,000 is earmarked for the general election and cannot be used in the primary.
“This fund-raising report shows that Pete’s message is resonating with Americans, and it’s proof that we are building an organization that can compete,” Mike Schmuhl, his campaign manager, said in an early-morning email to supporters announcing the fund-raising total.
Mr. Buttigieg’s rivals have mostly favored one fund-raising approach or the other.
Mr. Biden has concentrated his efforts on the broad network of Obama donors in major cities, but the 76-year-old former vice president hasn’t energized the small-dollar grass-roots world.
Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have sworn off closed-door big-donor events as a political strategy aimed at creating a wider universe of small donors.
Senator Kamala Harris of California, who raised the second-highest amount of money during the year’s first reporting period that ended March 31, is expected to raise less in the second quarter than the $24.8 million that Mr. Buttigieg announced Monday.
Last week in Miami, the Buttigieg campaign hosted a de facto retreat for the campaign’s top fund-raisers, which included strategy sessions with Mr. Buttigieg at the Miami Hilton and a debate watch party at the Miami Beach home of the home-furnishings entrepreneur Ira Statfeld.
The watch party included Mr. Buttigieg’s top fund-raising officials, known on his campaign as “investment directors”: Anthony Mercurio, a veteran of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign and Michael Bloomberg’s gun control group;
and Swati Mylavarapu, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who attended Harvard with Mr. Buttigieg and spent a year at Oxford with him when they were Rhodes scholars.
Also in attendance was Lucas Carroll, a Boston College undergraduate who in January started a “Pete Buttigieg for President” Facebook page and then used it to raise about $35,000 for the campaign.
Between his freshman and sophomore years, Mr. Carroll is spending the summer as a fund-raising intern at Mr. Buttigieg’s headquarters in South Bend.
“It’s a young campaign,” said Bryan Rafanelli, a Democratic fund-raising veteran from Boston who planned Chelsea Clinton’s 2011 wedding and hosted a Fenway Park event for Mr. Buttigieg.
“This wasn’t a room filled with Obama and Clinton finance people.
” But there a lot of Obama fund-raisers involved, many of them former ambassadors.
Tod Sedgwick, who was Mr. Obama’s ambassador to Slovakia, is among a group of former diplomats who are bundling contributions for Mr. Buttigieg.
David Jacobson, Mr. Obama’s ambassador to Canada, is hosting a fund-raiser for Mr. Buttigieg in Chicago Tuesday.
Timothy Broas (the Netherlands), John Phillips (Italy) and Bill Eacho (Austria) have also raised money for Mr. Buttigieg.
“Obama tended to have the larger bundlers, and they would have campaign events every quarter,” Mr. Sedgwick said.
“These guys have a national investment council and they pretty much add anyone who they think is making an effort to raise money.
” After suspending most of his fund-raising schedule the last two weeks to attend to protests over the police shooting and to prepare for the debate, Mr. Buttigieg is back on the road this week.
Mr. Jacobson is hosting a high-dollar event in Chicago on Tuesday.
In Massachusetts, there is a $2,800-per-ticket event Friday in Provincetown, a $250 brunch Saturday on Nantucket and a $2,800 breakfast on Nantucket.
Those high-dollar events are bracketed around a “grass-roots” event Saturday afternoon on Martha’s Vineyard for which tickets start at $15.
The campaign raised $1.1 million from grass-roots events and another $550,000 from small-dollar bundlers in the second quarter, an official said.
“They are innovating every single minute of every single day,” said Brendan Mullen, a cybersecurity executive who was the Democratic nominee for South Bend’s House seat in 2012 and who attended the campaign’s Miami debate events.
“I’ve never seen anything scale at the speed they are.
It’s scaling faster than any start-up in the history of America.
” Mr. Buttigieg’s finance team has grown from three employees at its outset to 28, with staff members in most major markets and several devoted to online and grass-roots events.
When he began his campaign, Mr. Buttigieg would tell prospective donors he was not “asking for monogamy” in terms of whose campaign they supported.
In recent weeks, his top fund-raising aides have been trying to pick off donors and bundlers who have committed to other candidates in the race, offering private meetings with Mr. Buttigieg.
Kevin Johnson, a West Point graduate and renewable energy executive who is co-hosting the Chicago fund-raiser with Mr. Jacobson, said Mr. Buttigieg has tapped into the network of military veterans.
“I’m not a historical donor like other folks, like Mr. Jacobson, and the campaign has welcomed me in,” Mr. Johnson said.
“I’m helping to bring in other veterans of color, and other veteran entrepreneurs of color that Pete’s message speaks to.
” Mr. Buttigieg’s fund-raising totals are short of what Mr. Obama and Mrs.
Clinton raised at the same juncture of their 2008 campaigns.
During the second quarter of 2007, Mr. Obama collected $33 million, while Mrs.
Clinton took in $27 million.
Both were more widely known than Mr. Buttigieg.
Still, Mr. Buttigieg’s total for the most recent quarter is more than three times what he raised in the first quarter, $7.1 million, which itself was an attention-grabbing figure that offered early evidence that his candidacy was catching on.
Mr. Buttigieg is the first Democratic candidate to announce his fund-raising total for the second quarter.
Other candidates will most likely publicize their numbers in the coming days, and all of them are required to report their fund-raising to the Federal Election Commission by July
15. Mr.
Buttigieg’s fund-raising pace is likely to allow him to remain in the race as long as he wants, a stunning turn of events for a candidate who began his exploratory campaign with a list of 24,000 email addresses and a staff of five people.
“Our dogs have more followers now on social media than I had in January when we got into this,” Mr. Buttigieg said during a recent interview.
“The trajectory has been dizzying.
We actually needed to level off because if it stays that dizzying, we’ll lose our balance.

64,1914930,"['\taugust 24', 'july 27']","For two women who had learned just the day before that they had tested positive for the coronavirus, the call on Saturday from the New York City Health Department offered some implausibly good news.
One of the women had to stay under quarantine.
The other, who had been without symptoms for a few days, was free to go about her life.
As strange as that sounded, what happened next further underscored the haphazard oversight of the quarantine process, one of the most important tools that public health officials have to curb the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.
Hours after the initial call, a Health Department worker came to the apartment where the women had been staying since they returned sick from a cruise, the women recalled.
He told them not to open the door and he slid a sheet of paper under it.
They said they were told to sign the document and slide it back out.
It was an isolation agreement: Both women were confined to the apartment indefinitely, until the Health Department declared them safe.
As the number of coronavirus cases in New York State rose to 142 on Monday, government officials scrambled to limit the spread.
Dozens of colleges and schools were closed, events were canceled and thousands of people were under quarantine.
Many thousands more were in home isolation around the United States.
But a week after the virus first appeared in New York, many state residents under quarantine feel they have largely been left to fend for themselves.
Local health departments in New York are supposed to check in daily even with people under precautionary quarantine, the lowest category of risk for contracting the virus.
But in many cases, they have not started to do so yet.
And when the authorities do issue guidance or directives, they can seem contradictory or illogical.
“We’ve been told everything from it was OK to go out, to we had to sign a release that we’re housebound now,” said one of the women who received an isolation order and who spoke on the condition that her name not be published.
“We’ve been told we don’t need to be tested, to we have to be tested.
We’ve been told that someone’s coming to our house to test us, to ‘You’ve got to find someplace.
’ Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus       newsletter.
“We’ve been told to call ahead for testing so that they’re prepared, and we get there, and nobody is prepared, we’re just in the emergency room with everyone else who’s waiting.
It’s been very crazy.
” The presence of the coronavirus in New York had been anticipated for weeks;
in January, New York City’s health commissioner declared that it was “inevitable.
” Yet city and state health officials said that because the outbreak had accelerated so quickly, it required a constantly evolving public health response.
“This thing is moving like a freight train,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday.
“A lot is changing quickly.
” A state official said the official containment guidelines  issued on Friday by the state Health Department had been put together in consultation with local health agencies and that they covered every quarantine situation that had come up.
“The guidance has never changed,” said Beth Garvey, special counsel to Gov.
Andrew M. Cuomo, adding that anyone with questions could call the coronavirus hotline.
“The recommendation has always been if you’re exposed or in close contact with someone who’s positive, you should isolate yourself.
“We are not leaving any individual or any local health department alone through this process,” she added.
“We are here to work with them and we will continue to work with them.
” A spokesman for New York City’s Health Department, Patrick Gallahue, said, “We’re committed to providing New Yorkers with the most up-to-date information.
As the situation has evolved, so too has our guidance to people.
” People under quarantine across the city nonetheless said they were finding more questions than answers about how to handle everything from the mundane chores of daily life to the most primal tasks of parenting.
What do you do if some of your children are quarantined and others aren’t?
Can two children under precautionary quarantine play with each other?
How should parents who are not under quarantine interact with children who are?
The other night, on the porch of her house in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, Jessica Haller took a calculated risk.
She hugged her teenage daughter.
A few blocks away, when Deborah Berkowitz’s 6-year-old son swooped in for a hug, she flinched.
“I just patted him on the head,” she said.
Both children seemed perfectly healthy but they were both under precautionary quarantine because people with the virus had been in their schools.
The mothers were not under quarantine.
Neither woman had any idea whether she had done the right thing, and both said that similar conundrums arose all day long.
“It’s funny,” said Ms. Haller, 44, a former technology executive who is running for City Council.
“I’m not allowed to let people into the house, but I’m allowed in and out of the house.
” Ms. Berkowitz, 46, who works at a museum in New York City, expressed a similar sentiment.
“I could go to work tomorrow,” she said.
“I think that’s weird.
It seems extreme on one end and ‘Eh, just a precaution’ on the other.
” Late Sunday, the principal at the private school that Ms. Haller’s four children attend, Salanter Akiba Riverdale Academy, which has been closed since last Tuesday, sent an email to parents acknowledging the confusion.
“Thank you for your patience as we continue to wait to hear back from the New York State Department of Health with clearly written quarantine guidelines,” the principal, Rabbi Binyamin Krauss, wrote.
“We know that many of you are awaiting clarification and answers.
” Rather than continue to wait, several parents at the school who are also doctors distributed their own guidelines for quarantined students and parents, addressing many of the questions the state has yet to answer.
Rabbi Krauss said that he, too, had sometimes been left to wonder about the most basic questions.
“Even the fact of whether I should be quarantined has not been consistent,” he said.
There were also more prosaic quandaries.
“Can we take out the trash?” asked the daughter of one of the women from the cruise, who put herself in precautionary quarantine after days of trying to get a straight answer from the health authorities on whether to do so.
“Can we go in our backyard?” The woman, like her mother, spoke on the condition that her name not be published.
The younger woman’s boyfriend chimed in: “What do the quarantined do about alternate side parking?” The city said on Monday that anyone under self-isolation who provided medical documentation or testimony can have their ticket dismissed.
Even when the authorities provide answers, they are often inconsistent.
Mr. Cuomo, for example, said last week that the “virus on a hard surface lives for about 24 hours.
” The next day, a deputy commissioner from the City Health Department said it can survive only “a couple of minutes.
” The state guidelines say that if someone is under precautionary quarantine, “food must be delivered to the person’s quarters.
” Mr. de Blasio’s guidance was a little looser.
“A person can stay in their apartment, can get, you know, if they’re able, food deliveries or friends or relatives can bring them food, whatever it is,” he said on Friday.
“That doesn’t mean you can’t, you know, get a little fresh air for a minute.
” On Friday, after the chief rabbi of the Westchester County synagogue at the center of the biggest cluster of cases had tested positive for coronavirus but had no symptoms, Yeshiva University, where the rabbi teaches, sought to reassure students and co-workers.
The university said that doctors from the city Health Department had told the school that “individuals who have been in contact with an asymptomatic person who has tested positive for Covid-19 virus do not need to be placed in quarantine.
” Yet on Saturday, the state Health Department ordered quarantine for members of the same synagogue who had been at any of five recent events, even though it was not clear whether symptomatic people were at all five events.
The state of emergency declared by Mr. Cuomo over the weekend should help his administration quickly hire workers to help local health authorities monitor quarantined patients, but the process is just getting started.
Ms. Haller, one of the Riverdale parents, spent most of last week wondering how to deal with her two older children being under precautionary quarantine while her two younger children were not.
By the end of the weekend, the question was moot: All students at her children’s school were placed under quarantine until at least March
16. This time, Ms. Haller did not hesitate when she got the news.
“I will, and have, hugged and wiped the tears of my little ones,” she said.

","For two women who had learned just the day before that they had tested positive for the coronavirus, the call on Saturday from the New York City Health Department offered some implausibly good news.
One of the women had to stay under quarantine.
The other, who had been without symptoms for a few days, was free to go about her life.
As strange as that sounded, what happened next further underscored the haphazard oversight of the quarantine process, one of the most important tools that public health officials have to curb the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.
Hours after the initial call, a Health Department worker came to the apartment where the women had been staying since they returned sick from a cruise, the women recalled.
He told them not to open the door and he slid a sheet of paper under it.
They said they were told to sign the document and slide it back out.
It was an isolation agreement: Both women were confined to the apartment indefinitely, until the Health Department declared them safe.
[Read our full Coronavirus in New York coverage here.] As the number of coronavirus cases in New York State rose to 142 on Monday, government officials scrambled to limit the spread.
Dozens of colleges and schools were closed, events were canceled and thousands of people were under quarantine.
Many thousands more were in home isolation around the United States.
But a week after the virus first appeared in New York, many state residents under quarantine feel they have largely been left to fend for themselves.
Local health departments in New York are supposed to check in daily even with people under precautionary quarantine, the lowest category of risk for contracting the virus.
But in many cases, they have not started to do so yet.
And when the authorities do issue guidance or directives, they can seem contradictory or illogical.
“We’ve been told everything from it was OK to go out, to we had to sign a release that we’re housebound now,” said one of the women who received an isolation order and who spoke on the condition that her name not be published.
“We’ve been told we don’t need to be tested, to we have to be tested.
We’ve been told that someone’s coming to our house to test us, to ‘You’ve got to find someplace.
’ “We’ve been told to call ahead for testing so that they’re prepared, and we get there, and nobody is prepared, we’re just in the emergency room with everyone else who’s waiting.
It’s been very crazy.
” The presence of the coronavirus in New York had been anticipated for weeks;
in January, New York City’s health commissioner declared that it was “inevitable.
” Yet city and state health officials said that because the outbreak had accelerated so quickly, it required a constantly evolving public health response.
“This thing is moving like a freight train,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday.
“A lot is changing quickly.
” A state official said the official containment guidelines  issued on Friday by the state Health Department had been put together in consultation with local health agencies and that they covered every quarantine situation that had come up.
“The guidance has never changed,” said Beth Garvey, special counsel to Gov.
Andrew M. Cuomo, adding that anyone with questions could call the coronavirus hotline.
“The recommendation has always been if you’re exposed or in close contact with someone who’s positive, you should isolate yourself.
“We are not leaving any individual or any local health department alone through this process,” she added.
“We are here to work with them and we will continue to work with them.
” A spokesman for New York City’s Health Department, Patrick Gallahue, said, “We’re committed to providing New Yorkers with the most up-to-date information.
As the situation has evolved, so too has our guidance to people.
” People under quarantine across the city nonetheless said they were finding more questions than answers about how to handle everything from the mundane chores of daily life to the most primal tasks of parenting.
What do you do if some of your children are quarantined and others aren’t?
Can two children under precautionary quarantine play with each other?
How should parents who are not under quarantine interact with children who are?
The other night, on the porch of her house in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, Jessica Haller took a calculated risk.
She hugged her teenage daughter.
A few blocks away, when Deborah Berkowitz’s 6-year-old son swooped in for a hug, she flinched.
“I just patted him on the head,” she said.
Both children seemed perfectly healthy but they were both under precautionary quarantine because people with the virus had been in their schools.
The mothers were not under quarantine.
Neither woman had any idea whether she had done the right thing, and both said that similar conundrums arose all day long.
“It’s funny,” said Ms. Haller, 44, a former technology executive who is running for City Council.
“I’m not allowed to let people into the house, but I’m allowed in and out of the house.
” Ms. Berkowitz, 46, who works at a museum in New York City, expressed a similar sentiment.
“I could go to work tomorrow,” she said.
“I think that’s weird.
It seems extreme on one end and ‘Eh, just a precaution’ on the other.
” Updated August 24, 2020 Late Sunday, the principal at the private school that Ms. Haller’s four children attend, Salanter Akiba Riverdale Academy, which has been closed since last Tuesday, sent an email to parents acknowledging the confusion.
“Thank you for your patience as we continue to wait to hear back from the New York State Department of Health with clearly written quarantine guidelines,” the principal, Rabbi Binyamin Krauss, wrote.
“We know that many of you are awaiting clarification and answers.
” Rather than continue to wait, several parents at the school who are also doctors distributed their own guidelines for quarantined students and parents, addressing many of the questions the state has yet to answer.
Rabbi Krauss said that he, too, had sometimes been left to wonder about the most basic questions.
“Even the fact of whether I should be quarantined has not been consistent,” he said.
There were also more prosaic quandaries.
“Can we take out the trash?” asked the daughter of one of the women from the cruise, who put herself in precautionary quarantine after days of trying to get a straight answer from the health authorities on whether to do so.
“Can we go in our backyard?” The woman, like her mother, spoke on the condition that her name not be published.
The younger woman’s boyfriend chimed in: “What do the quarantined do about alternate side parking?” The city said on Monday that anyone under self-isolation who provided medical documentation or testimony can have their ticket dismissed.
Even when the authorities provide answers, they are often inconsistent.
Mr. Cuomo, for example, said last week that the “virus on a hard surface lives for about 24 hours.
” The next day, a deputy commissioner from the City Health Department said it can survive only “a couple of minutes.
” The state guidelines say that if someone is under precautionary quarantine, “food must be delivered to the person’s quarters.
” Mr. de Blasio’s guidance was a little looser.
“A person can stay in their apartment, can get, you know, if they’re able, food deliveries or friends or relatives can bring them food, whatever it is,” he said on Friday.
“That doesn’t mean you can’t, you know, get a little fresh air for a minute.
” On Friday, after the chief rabbi of the Westchester County synagogue at the center of the biggest cluster of cases had tested positive for coronavirus but had no symptoms, Yeshiva University, where the rabbi teaches, sought to reassure students and co-workers.
The university said that doctors from the city Health Department had told the school that “individuals who have been in contact with an asymptomatic person who has tested positive for Covid-19 virus do not need to be placed in quarantine.
” Yet on Saturday, the state Health Department ordered quarantine for members of the same synagogue who had been at any of five recent events, even though it was not clear whether symptomatic people were at all five events.

Conservative economist Stephen Moore has been busy these days.
A member of the president’s economic task force, he’s been pushing the administration and governors to loosen the stay-at-home orders as soon as possible.
He’s been working closely with groups like FreedomWorks to nurture and promote some of the protests across the country.
And he’s been on a bit of a media tour, warning Americans that the country stands on the verge of “economic carnage” if it doesn’t reopen soon.
A conservative commentator and Trump campaign economic adviser, Mr. Moore has long courted controversy.
His nomination to a seat on the Federal Reserve board last year was pulled by the administration after Republican lawmakers criticized his past comments about women, economists questioned his track record and some conservatives said he lacked the “intellectual gravitas” for the post.
There’s no question about his partisan credentials.
Mr. Moore was one of the founders of the Club for Growth, which advocates limited government and low taxes.
In 2012, Mr. Moore helped design tax cuts in Kansas that exploded the state’s budget without producing a promised economic boom.
Mr. Moore offered his broad thoughts on the economic impacts of the coronavirus, noting that he’s not a public health expert — nor has he completed any studies of the effects as of yet.
We spoke to him about the risks of reopening, what he’s advising the president and his predictions of a coming “economic civil war.
” (As always, our conversation has been edited and condensed.) Hi, thanks for speaking with me.
So starting this week, some states are reopening;
some states aren’t.
These places that are reopening — like Georgia, Tennessee — are they right to do so?
We really are seeing the economic carnage cascade in a big way.
And as an economist — I’m not a health expert, I don’t pretend to be, I’m an economist — we’re doing some studies on this now that there is a big, big difference in terms what the economy is going to look like six months and nine months and a year from now based on opening the economy, say, May 1st versus June 1st or June 15th.
You sit on the president’s economic council, is that what you are advising him right now?
For the good of the country, we have to really get things opened.
I said, “Mr.
President, if you can get the economy open by May 1 and right from that date” — and by the way, that, of course, means that some states will open and others won’t — “that you could possibly see this recovery by the end of the summer, and we can really get through this.
” Why do you think we’re late in reopening?
Everybody can look at the map.
And there’s a severe breakout in about 15 major metropolitan areas.
And any pandemic is an urban experience, right?
So the idea of having a policy in Lincoln, Nebraska, or Des Moines, Iowa, or Boise, Idaho, that’s the same as New York City is ridiculous.
What we should have done all along is really done this in a more surgical way rather than having a widespread shutdown.
I just completely reject this instant response — what I’m saying is, “Oh, this is putting profits and greed over saving lives,” and so on.
That’s a false choice.
After all, the people who are being hurt the most here are really the least among us, the poorest people, the middle-class people who really live paycheck to paycheck.
And they are the ones who are experiencing the real deprivation and the ruination of their lives.
The misery and toil that we’re putting on people at the bottom is extraordinary here.
What public health officials would say is that part of the reason those places haven’t seen the same level of illness is because they did shut down.
And if you reopen the virus will spread.
Well, it’s a fair point.
I can’t argue against that.
I’m not a public health official.
Maybe I’ve got this wrong, but it’s because people get these diseases in congested areas.
So in the middle of Little Washington, Va.
, you’re not having people crowded together.
So you don’t need the same kind of measures in a little town like that as you do in New York City or Chicago or Detroit.
Do you think the public health officials are taking the economic issues seriously enough?
I can’t talk for everyone in the public health community but when people like Fauci — I know one thing that just set people off was when Fauci said, “We’re sorry for the inconvenience.
” Look, this is no inconvenience.
This is a trauma that we’ve never seen our country in 75 years.
And this is life altering for people, and many people will never get their lives back to what it was before.
So that’s insulting, frankly, to say that to the people who are — 20 or 23 million people, it’s probably going to be closer to 30 million by the end of this week, in unemployment lines.
You have to calibrate that versus what are we doing to public health and our society, our societal well-being by impoverishing our people.
And that’s what we’re doing.
There’s also a racial component, right, which is that the people more likely to get sick and die from the virus are more likely to be African-American.
We’ve seen that data too.
So how do you weigh the racial inequalities of this virus?
The people who are suffering the most are minorities.
There’s no question about that.
By the way, that’s in no small part because minorities tend to be living in major cities where they’re living close together.
But they also are the people — I mean, look at the people in the soup lines and the people waiting for The Salvation Army trucks.
I mean, they are minorities as well.
They are the ones whose lives have been really shattered.
We can use really good public safety measures, social distancing the work force, disinfectants everywhere, masks.
I was thinking this morning, and this is just kind of a thought experiment because I was thinking about this — why don’t we just put everybody in a space outfit or something like that?
No.
Seriously, I mean — Well, we’d have to make the space outfits, right?
I know we don’t have space outfits [laughter]— I mean, just thinking out loud, and maybe this is a crazy idea, but instead of just locking down the economy, putting everybody in a kind of — you’re right.
You have to make 200 million of these, but it wouldn’t have cost $3 trillion to do that.
And you can have for months people just walking around in these kind of — I mean, I was looking online, and there are all these kinds of suits that they’re building now that you’re not exposed and you’re breath — kind of ventilator.
Speaking of lacking mass production, do you think the testing is there to reopen?
There’s an argument that you can’t go back to work without more testing.
I have a strong feeling about that, which is I think that the people who are in favor of keeping the economy shut down, that testing has become an excuse to keep the economy locked down for more weeks.
That’s become the mantra, right?
We have to have testing.
Nobody argues that testing isn’t a good thing.
But can we afford to wait three weeks or whatever it’s going to take so we have all the testing?
No.
We’ve got to start now.
Look, the summer is going to be a catastrophe.
It’s going to be really, really bad.
We’re going to have long, long unemployment lines, and we’re going to see 15, 20 percent unemployment, just horrific.
They talk about bending the curve of the disease, but we also have to bend the curve of unemployment, poverty.
Americans, I think, are just under this delusion that what’s going to happen is a month from now, it will all be — we’ll have hopefully conquered this disease, and we can all go outside again.
It will be sort of back to what it was.
No.
It’s going to be like a nuclear bomb was dropped on the economy.
People aren’t just going to go right back to their jobs and so on.
It’s going to be really, really, really rough.
We’re going to have effects that affect our society for a decade from this shutdown.
Why do you think the blue states have been more cautious about reopening?
This country is so divided along ideological grounds today that it is — it’s frightening to me actually.
What you’re going to see is a kind of economic civil war over the next 10 weeks between red states and blue states.
Red states are opening;
blue states aren’t.
You’re going to have commerce going on in Nashville, Tennessee, but not in Detroit, not in Chicago, and not in New York City.
It sounds like the world you envision to start as soon as possible is one where we’re all wearing masks;
some businesses are open;
some businesses aren’t open;
and it’s county by county.
Or do you think everything should just sort of open up, and we go back with masks and social distance the best we can, or?
I’m just saying let’s be really smart about it.
And maybe by a county-by-county basis.
Definitely using disinfectants, using screening, using — when you go to the White House, you have to take your temperature.
I don’t have a problem with if you go into a restaurant, you have to take your temperature, or if you go into any kind of public place — and opening businesses that don’t have people in close proximity or having tables apart from each other and that kind of thing and just doing it on a rolling basis.
Look, there’s going to be risks to this.
The nightmare is if we start to reopen up things on a rolling basis, and then we have another outbreak.
And that would be horrific.
That would be horrific in every way, right?
So I’m not insensitive to the risks here because we just don’t know what is going to happen with this virus.
All I’m saying is that if we keep economy shut down for another month, we will have a kind of second Great Depression, and that involves untold human misery that we don’t even want to contemplate.
But isn’t the concern of the second outbreak part of what necessitates the stay-at-home orders?
Are you saying because we don’t know when, or if, a second outbreak could happen, the health risk is worth taking because the economic costs are potentially so severe?
I don’t even like to put it in a trade-off.
What I’m saying is we have no choice.
If you don’t have an economy that’s functioning, you don’t have a society.
I mean, we’re going to have people starving so we don’t have any choice here really.
We have to get things up and running.
We have to be really smart.
We have to have a functioning economy.
How are we going to do it in the smartest way possible with the best screening, best testing?
So that’s my take.
Are you wearing a mask when you go out?
Yeah.
Oh, you are?
The reason I’m doing it is because I think it makes people feel uncomfortable if you don’t have a mask.
So I’m not doing it for my own health.
Look, I think we should all be sensitive to people.
There’s no big deal about wearing a mask.
I mean, do I like wearing it?
No. I don’t.
It gets kind of smelly, stuff like that.
But people should be sensitive to other people’s concerns.
But look, I have a problem now when I go out and play basketball with my kids and — with four, five kids playing basketball.
And then the neighbors are calling the police on us.
I mean, it’s like ridiculous.
I mean, what is this?
Russia?
I have a big problem with that, with busybodies and bossy people.
All right.
Well, thank you so much.
You too.
Stay healthy.

We’re sharing some of your dispatches from around the globe about life in the time of coronavirus.
Today, we have Nancy Tolson, of Indianapolis.
I am 84 with mild C.O.P.D.
I live alone, and believe me, since late February, that is completely alone!
I want to stay alive long enough to see my great-grandchildren again, and I have determined that it will take a year or more to do so.
I will continue my social distancing until there is a vaccine.
Fortunately, I drive, and can pick up grocery items outside the store.
I get meds at the drive-through.
I spend my days reading, talking by phone with family and with friends I haven’t been in touch with until recently, watching some TV (never the White House briefings!), and keeping in touch with various groups by email.
I am finishing the wonderful book by John Meacham, “The Soul of America.
” My biggest concern is that I am not able to visit my two CASA cases.
I am a volunteer for Child Advocates, and our responsibility is to watch over children and youth in foster care, making sure that they are safe and secure.
I would normally visit my homes at least once a month, but now cannot do so.
I am speaking with them by phone, but this is not as satisfactory since it is important to get visuals about how they look, react, etc.
As for my mental state, I am content most of the time.
I do tear up at some of the public announcements from stations, businesses and individuals when they send love and good wishes, but I have learned one thing in 84 years: This too shall pass.
Have you come up with a clever way to manage social distancing?
How’s that distance learning going?
We want to hear it.

So I’m not insensitive to the risks here because we just don’t know what is going to happen with this virus.
All I’m saying is that if we keep economy shut down for another month, we will have a kind of second Great Depression, and that involves untold human misery that we don’t even want to contemplate.
But isn’t the concern of the second outbreak part of what necessitates the stay-at-home orders?
Are you saying because we don’t know when, or if, a second outbreak could happen, the health risk is worth taking because the economic costs are potentially so severe?
Updated August 17, 2020 I don’t even like to put it in a trade-off.
What I’m saying is we have no choice.
If you don’t have an economy that’s functioning, you don’t have a society.
I mean, we’re going to have people starving so we don’t have any choice here really.
We have to get things up and running.
We have to be really smart.
We have to have a functioning economy.
How are we going to do it in the smartest way possible with the best screening, best testing?
So that’s my take.
Are you wearing a mask when you go out?
Yeah.
Oh, you are?
The reason I’m doing it is because I think it makes people feel uncomfortable if you don’t have a mask.
So I’m not doing it for my own health.
Look, I think we should all be sensitive to people.
There’s no big deal about wearing a mask.
I mean, do I like wearing it?
No. I don’t.
It gets kind of smelly, stuff like that.
But people should be sensitive to other people’s concerns.
But look, I have a problem now when I go out and play basketball with my kids and — with four, five kids playing basketball.
And then the neighbors are calling the police on us.
I mean, it’s like ridiculous.
I mean, what is this?
Russia?
I have a big problem with that, with busybodies and bossy people.
All right.
Well, thank you so much.
You too.

We’re sharing some of your dispatches from around the globe about life in the time of coronavirus.
Today, we have Nancy Tolson, of Indianapolis.
I am 84 with mild C.O.P.D.
I live alone, and believe me, since late February, that is completely alone!
I want to stay alive long enough to see my great-grandchildren again, and I have determined that it will take a year or more to do so.
I will continue my social distancing until there is a vaccine.
Fortunately, I drive, and can pick up grocery items outside the store.
I get meds at the drive-through.
I spend my days reading, talking by phone with family and with friends I haven’t been in touch with until recently, watching some TV (never the White House briefings!), and keeping in touch with various groups by email.
I am finishing the wonderful book by John Meacham, “The Soul of America.
” My biggest concern is that I am not able to visit my two CASA cases.
I am a volunteer for Child Advocates, and our responsibility is to watch over children and youth in foster care, making sure that they are safe and secure.
I would normally visit my homes at least once a month, but now cannot do so.
I am speaking with them by phone, but this is not as satisfactory since it is important to get visuals about how they look, react, etc.
As for my mental state, I am content most of the time.
I do tear up at some of the public announcements from stations, businesses and individuals when they send love and good wishes, but I have learned one thing in 84 years: This too shall pass.
Have you come up with a clever way to manage social distancing?
How’s that distance learning going?
We want to hear it.

66,1812246,"['God bless him', 'mr franken', 'Senate vote', 'extend lifetime', 'lifetime compensation', 'simple']","WASHINGTON — Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, and several female senators aligned themselves with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand on Tuesday, standing by their calls for Al Franken to resign from the Senate more than 18 months ago following numerous allegations of sexual misconduct.
Their statements came as a number of other lawmakers, including Senator Dick Durbin, the second most powerful Democrat in the Senate, said they had second thoughts about their role in pushing out Mr. Franken, a former senator from Minnesota.
While few Democrats are eager to revisit the politically painful situation surrounding Mr. Franken’s departure, particularly with a presidential primary under way, he is back in the news after telling The New Yorker, in a story published Monday that contained some of his first public comments since his resignation, that he “absolutely” regretted his decision to step down rather than fight the accusations.
And that means that Ms. Gillibrand, his onetime friend and the first Democratic colleague to call for his resignation, is back in the news too.
“There is no prize for someone who tries to hold accountable a powerful man who is good at his day job,” she said at a town-hall event Monday night, responding to Mr. Franken’s remarks.
“But we should have the courage to do it anyway.
” Ms. Gillibrand, who has predicated her presidential campaign on being an unyielding advocate for women, expressed no regrets, and neither did some of the women who joined her in calling on Mr. Franken to step down.
“With the first accuser, we didn’t call for his resignation from the get go.
It was a difficult decision,” Senator Mazie Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, said on Tuesday.
“But when the eighth person comes forward, there’s a pattern.
Women have been putting up with this B.S. from time immortal.
And we’re sick of it.
” Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington and the highest-ranking Democratic woman in Senate leadership, said she stood by her decision to call for Mr. Franken’s resignation.
So did Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts and a presidential candidate, through a spokeswoman.
“Al Franken’s decision to step down was the right decision — for the good of the Senate and the good of the country,” said Mr. Schumer.
“I regret losing him as a colleague, but given the circumstances, it was inevitable.
” Senator Kamala Harris, another presidential candidate and one of seven female senators who met with Mr. Schumer in December 2017 to express their frustration with Mr. Franken, did not respond to a request for comment about her current stance.
Mr. Franken’s supporters have long blamed Ms. Gillibrand for his abrupt political demise, while Ms. Gillibrand’s backers have expressed bewilderment that, somehow, a woman has been held responsible for a man’s alleged transgressions.
On the presidential campaign trail, it is Ms. Gillibrand who faces the bulk of criticism over the episode, even though she is one of six candidates who called for Mr. Franken’s resignation from their perches in the Senate.
Ms. Gillibrand, who has staked much of her bid on her feminist credentials, has faced periodic yet persistent questions about Mr. Franken, starting with her first trip to Iowa in January.
Some prominent Democratic donors, including the billionaire investor George Soros, have refused to back Ms. Gillibrand’s campaign over the issue.
The situation has become a perpetual distraction for her struggling campaign.
The latest flare-up with Mr. Franken occurred as Ms. Gillibrand prepared to take a victory lap on an issue that has been a centerpiece of her political career: securing permanent funding for the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund, established to aid first responders, their families and those who became ill following the terrorist attacks.
Ms Gillibrand has consistently said that while the decision to resign was Mr. Franken’s alone to make, the only decision she faced was whether or not to “remain silent.
” In an interview in January, she said of Mr. Franken, “If he wanted to stick it out for a six-month ethics investigation, God bless him;
if he wanted to sue every woman who made an allegation against him, God bless him — those are his decisions.
My decision was really simple.
I was either going to stay silent and carry water for something I didn’t believe in or I was going to say what I believed: that it’s not O.K.” Jess Morales Rocketto, a Democratic activist, said Ms. Gillibrand should be celebrated for standing up for her principles.
“Kirsten Gillibrand is asked to explain why she stood with sexual harassment and assault survivors while there is very little to no interrogation for Al Franken why he perpetuated those crimes,” he said.
“It should actually be a shining accomplishment for her.
Its hard to be courageous against your friends.
” Ms. Gillibrand was hardly alone in arguing Mr. Franken should step down, and her news release calling for his resignation came just minutes before similar calls from her colleagues.
By the time Mr. Franken stepped down in December 2017, three dozen Democratic senators — including fellow presidential candidates Michael Bennet, Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders, Ms. Harris and Ms. Warren — had called on him to do so.
The tipping point appeared to be an allegation from a former congressional aide of an unwanted advance by Mr. Franken.
Mr. Durbin said Tuesday he wished the Senate “had given some time for due process.
” But he added that Ms. Gillibrand doesn’t shoulder all the blame for Mr. Franken’s departure.
“There was a momentum behind it which was for a number of reasons unusual,” he said.
“She might have been the first name on the list, but it was a strong list of Democratic senators.
” On Capitol Hill, few Democrats were eager to reopen a divisive political issue for the party.
“Why is that coming up now?” asked Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, before waving away any further questions.
“I think it was a very unfortunate time.
I’ll leave it at that,” said Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan.
At the event on Monday, hosted by Mic and Bustle Digital Group, Ms. Gillibrand cited a “double standard,” noting that female senators were pressed for comment about Mr. Franken far more frequently than their male colleagues.
“Who is being held accountable for Al Franken’s decision to resign?
Women senators, including me.
It’s outrageous.
It’s absurd,” she said.
Ms. Gillibrand has argued that Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat, would not have won a special election in Alabama if Mr. Franken had not stepped aside and provided the party with a clear message against the Republican candidate, Roy S. Moore, a state jurist accused of sexually assaulting teenage girls.
Others in her party, including Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader who nudged Mr. Franken out of the Senate, voiced similar concerns.
In the New Yorker piece, Mr. Franken alleges that Mr. Schumer forced him to leave, saying that if he refused to resign by 5 p.m. the entire Democratic caucus would demand he quit.
People close to Mr. Schumer disputed that description of events, pointing to Mr. Franken’s failure to sufficiently address the allegations both publicly and privately within the Democratic caucus as creating a situation where the political pressure on him grew overwhelming.
Mr. Schumer, they point out, was one of the last Democrats in the Senate to come out against Mr. Franken.
“Senator Schumer warned Senator Franken repeatedly that it was certain that there would be procedures used against him in the Senate, including the fact that Republicans would go to the floor and demand censure, call for stripping of his committee assignments and more,” said Justin Goodman, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer.
“And given the number of senators who called for his resignation, such moves would have inevitably succeeded.
” The magazine quoted seven current and former Democratic senators — five men and two women — as saying they regretted calling for Mr. Franken to step down.
Mr. Franken had appeared unhappy with his choice in real time.
“There is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office,” he said in his farewell speech.
In recent months, Mr. Franken has gingerly waded back into public life, after sinking into what he called a clinical depression.
“I’m angry at my colleagues who did this.
I think they were just trying to get past one bad news cycle,” he told The New Yorker.
His resignation has divided Democrats, with some activists and donors blaming Ms. Gillibrand for costing the party a rising star who was able to effectively take on President Trump.
Wealthy contributors continue to refer to Mr. Franken as a factor in Ms. Gillibrand’s inability to raise money for her campaign and her lack of traction in the polls.
Lou Frillman, a Democratic fund-raiser in Minnesota who had supported Mr. Franken, said the party is now missing “a powerful voice” who had opposed the Trump administration at a moment of “national emergency.
” “I’m not going to get into a debate about any of this with Senator Gillibrand.
All I’m going to say is it seems to me that the idea of proportionality was never considered,” Mr. Frillman said of the accusations against Mr. Franken.
But in response to Mr. Franken’s regrets, Mr. Frillman said, “You’ve got to blame yourself.
He’s the one who pulled the plug.
” Ms. Gillibrand made a similar point at her event on Monday.
“Blaming a woman for the actions of a man: I don’t know.
I don’t believe in it, ” she said.
“I don’t think it’s right.

Mr. Peebles was awarded half the prize, while Mr. Mayor and Mr. Queloz shared their portion, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced in Stockholm on Tuesday.

","This year’s Nobel Prize in Physics went to an astrophysicist who came up with sweeping ideas to explain how matter in the young universe swirled into galaxies, and to two astronomers who showed that other stars similar to the sun also possess planets.
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced on Tuesday that James Peebles, a professor emeritus at Princeton University, shared the prize — and half the prize money of more than $900,000 — for his theories that have helped explain 13.8 billion years of cosmological history.
The other half honored work by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz, who were the first to discover a planet circling around a distant sun-like star.
The two areas of research, while vastly different in scope and topic, “really, sort of tell us something very essential — existential — about our place in the universe,” Ulf Danielsson, a member of the committee that selected the winners, said during an online broadcast.
James Peebles, the Albert Einstein professor of science at Princeton, was not entirely surprised by the early morning phone call from Stockholm.
“I have been working in cosmology for 55 years,” he said in an interview.
“I’m the last man standing, so to speak, from those early days.
It had crossed my mind.
” Michel Mayor is an astrophysicist and professor emeritus of astronomy at the University of Geneva.
He formally retired in 2007, according to the Planetary Society, but remains active at the Geneva Observatory.
Didier Queloz is a professor of physics at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University, and at the University of Geneva.
He said that at first he did not believe what he had discovered.
In the 1960s, when Dr. Peebles began studying the universe, there were few observations to prove or disprove anyone’s conjectures.
Cosmological distances were often just rough guesses, and estimates of the age of the universe varied widely.
“There were bits of evidence,” he said.
“But they were sparse and scanty and not nearly enough to convince me that we had the right general idea.
” Dr. Peebles’s work helped place cosmology on a more solid, mathematical foundation.
“No one has done more to establish our current paradigm than Jim,” Michael Turner of the University of Chicago and the Kavli Foundation, a philanthropy that supports science, wrote in an email.
In 1964, two radio astronomers, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, discovered by accident a background hiss of microwaves pervading the universe.
Dr. Penzias and Dr. Wilson, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978, were perplexed until they came across theoretical calculations by other scientists, including Dr. Peebles.
Dr. Peebles and his colleagues had predicted this background radiation, a residue from about 400,000 years after the Big Bang, when the universe had cooled enough for hydrogen and helium atoms to form.
The microwave background was almost uniform in all directions, reflecting a temperature of only a few degrees above absolute zero, but it was not perfectly smooth.
Dr. Peebles calculated that there should be faint fluctuations, and that the fluctuations would reveal regions where matter had begun to clump together — the structure that would eventually be revealed as stars, galaxies and clusters of galaxies.
Like sound waves produced by a musical instrument, the fluctuations had characteristic wavelengths from vibrations bouncing back and forth.
In the early 1980s, Dr. Peebles proposed the idea that the universe was filled with unseen “cold dark matter” — particles that did not interact with ordinary matter but whose gravitational pull formed galaxies and clusters of galaxies.
A couple of years later, he added to his model a term that Albert Einstein had originally proposed but later discarded as his “biggest blunder.
” [Read The Times obituary of Vera Rubin, who transformed physics with her work on dark matter.] Einstein had invented this idea, called the cosmological constant, to balance gravity and keep the universe static and unchanging.
But astronomers established that the universe is actually expanding.
Dr. Peebles utilized the cosmological constant, now known as dark energy, for a different reason: He aimed to show that the universe contained considerably less mass than was thought at the time.
The cold dark matter idea caught on, but many were skeptical,including Dr. Peebles, who also proposed other ideas.
“In the 80s, I thought there was a pretty good chance we were not on the right track,” he said.
Around 1990, observations of the universe caught up to Dr. Peebles’s theories.
Scientists measured some of the fundamental fluctuations in the microwave background, and a NASA mission, the Cosmic Background Explorer, captured a wealth of confirming data.
In 1998, two teams of astronomers discovered that Dr. Peebles was right, and that the universe was not only expanding but accelerating.
That research also garnered a Physics Nobel, in 2011.
“Jim has been involved in almost all of the major developments since the discovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1965 and has been the leader of the field for all that time,” Dr. Turner said.
Dr. Peebles noted that much of the universe remains mysterious.
Scientists have yet to identify what makes up dark matter or dark energy.
The other half of this year’s Physics Nobel goes to research that filled in a missing piece of the observable universe.
Astronomers had long presumed there must be planets in orbits around other stars.
But until a quarter-century ago, they knew of none.
Over the decades, claims of planets evaporated on closer examination.
In 1992, astronomers found the first planets outside the solar system, but those orbited an exploded star, making them an unlikely place for life to exist.
At the time, some astronomers had begun to wonder if they would ever find planets.
“Maybe most stars don’t form with planets and our solar system is unusual and life is incredibly rare,” said Debra A. Fischer, a professor of astronomy at Yale.
Didier Queloz was not expecting to find any planets, either.
“It was pretty clear I had no hope,” he said.
As a graduate student working with Dr. Mayor, he was setting up the equipment and writing the software to begin a search at the Haute-Provence Observatory in southern France.
If they found a planet, they would not see it directly.
Rather, they were looking for a periodic wobble in the colors of light from the star.
The gravity of a planet would pull on the star.
The motion back and forth would shift the wavelengths of the starlight, much as a whistle of a train or the siren on a police car rises when approaching and falls when receding.
This technique was sensitive enough to detect something the size of Jupiter, but astronomers thought that planets the size of Jupiter would be as far from their stars as Jupiter is from Earth, and take years to pinpoint.
Thus, any discoveries would come long after Dr. Queloz finished his thesis.
In 1994, Dr. Mayor went on sabbatical at the University of Hawaii.
“Off he went, and you can imagine my surprise when a couple of weeks later, I started the program and identified that star that had a completely erratic pattern,’” Dr. Queloz recalled.
He had started observing 20 bright stars in our galactic neighborhood.
The erratic star was 51 Pegasi, similar to our sun and 51 light years away.
The planet in the data was as big as Jupiter, but it hugged the star in a tight orbit that took only four days to complete.
Dr. Queloz did not feel ecstatic, but rather ashamed, certain that something was wrong with the instrument or his software.
“I really panicked at that time,” Dr. Queloz said.
“I didn’t talk to Michel at all.
” Almost six months later, Dr. Queloz was convinced his data was real, and he sent a fax to Dr. Mayor saying he thought he might have discovered a planet.
“Michel had this very nice answer,” Dr. Queloz said.
“He said, ‘Yes, maybe.
’” Years later, Dr. Mayor admitted that he did not believe the data.
“He just wanted to be nice with me,” Dr. Queloz said.
But when they made more observations, the same pattern continued.
On Oct. 6, 1995, they announced their discovery.
Although this broiling planet was not habitable, it pointed to how astronomers could now study planetary systems that could be similar to our own.
“Completely transformative,” Dr. Fischer said of the discovery.
“We are the middle of a scientific revolution that people won’t appreciate until a hundred years go by.
” More than 4,000 exoplanets have been discovered in our Milky Way galaxy since Dr. Mayor and Dr. Queloz announced their results, including some that may be habitable.
More and more are being spotted with space telescopes like TESS, launched by NASA last year.
And it turns out that large planets orbiting so close to their stars are not unusual.
“It’s really the science at its best,” Dr. Queloz said.
“The data alone talking and telling you a story, which is different from the story that people have built up by studying the solar system.
” The prize last year went to Arthur Ashkin of the United States, Gérard Mourou of France and Donna Strickland of Canada for their work with lasers and microscopy, developing tools such as optical tweezers and chirped pulse amplification.
Dr. Strickland was only the third woman to win the prize.
The prize for medicine and physiology was awarded to William G. Kaelin Jr., Peter J. Ratcliffe and Gregg L. Semenza for their work in discovering how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.

The fire raging in the heart of Sonoma County, north of San Francisco, doubled in size during a 24-hour period, destroying nearly 100 buildings and testing an estimated 3,400 firefighters, public safety officials said Sunday night.
The containment of the Kincade fire dropped from 10 percent to 5 percent from Saturday to Sunday night, according to Cal Fire, the state firefighting agency, which is expected to get a brief reprieve on Monday from high winds that have acted as a dangerous accelerant.
More high winds are in the forecast Tuesday night into Wednesday.
The fire threatened 80,000 buildings across an expanding evacuation zone, which included a warning but not an order for part of neighboring Napa County.
Two firefighters sustained burns, one of whom was airlifted to UC Davis Medical Center, the authorities said.
Pacific Gas and Electric officials said the power company notified 500,000 customers in Northern California on Sunday that they might have their power shut off on Tuesday, with much of the same footprint affected as this weekend’s shut-offs.
Some customers might not have their power restored before the next shut-off, said Andy Vesey, the chief executive of PG&
E, who noted during a news conference Sunday night that public safety was paramount.
“We look for the highest risk zones where we have the potential for catastrophic wildfire,” Mr. Vesey said.
“We will not roll the dice when it comes to public safety.
” Those potential shut-offs, which could affect 32 counties throughout the state, were announced within hours of the power cuts on Sunday that affected nearly 3 million people, the largest fire-prevention blackouts in California history.
The new round would be the fourth time this month that the company has intentionally turned off electricity to large numbers of customers, some of whom had power for only a few hours between earlier blackouts.
PG&
E’s policy of pre-emptively cutting power in the hope of preventing its lines and equipment from causing fires — as has happened several times in recent years — has angered customers, regulators and politicians.
Leaders in the Democratic-controlled State Senate have organized a panel to review PG&
E’s actions.
Mr. Vesey said he had spoken to customers whose power had been shut off at a community resource center set up by the utility and acknowledged their discontent.
“You’re right — what we do is not popular,” Mr. Vesey said during a news conference on Sunday night.
“I will not tell you that people congratulated us.
People are angry.

The worst kind of weather for wildfires — strong, gusty winds and very low humidity — will return on Tuesday after a relative respite on Monday, the National Weather Service said, raising the prospect of more fire outbreaks and rapid growth of the blazes that are already burning.
The agency has posted “red flag” warnings for most of Northern California and much of Southern California, taking effect at various times on Tuesday.
Winds gusts of up to 60 miles an hour could be expected beginning in the morning over a vast stretch of the state from the Sierras to the Pacific and from the southern fringes of the Bay Area north nearly to the Oregon border, except for coastal areas north of Sonoma County.
Similar conditions will develop Tuesday night from Santa Barbara south to the Mexican border and well inland, other than coastal areas south of Anaheim, and would persist into Thursday, forecasters said.
Red-flag weather has played an important role in driving the growth of the Kincade, Getty and other fires, and has prompted pre-emptive blackouts by utility companies hoping to keep wind-damaged power lines and equipment from touching off more blazes.
The power may still be off for millions of Californians when the next blackout comes, state officials said on Monday.
Roughly 587,000 Pacific Gas &
Electric customers remained without power on Monday afternoon because of intentional blackouts meant to limit the risk of wildfires.
The company said it had restored service to an estimated 375,000 to 400,000 of the 970,000 affected customers.
But it said many customers could remain without electricity for much of this week because more high winds are expected.
The utility said about 605,000 customers in 29 counties were at risk of losing power in advance of high winds on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Each customer represents a household or a business, so the actual number of people affected has approached three million.
PG&
E’s handling of the blackouts has been under scrutiny in recent weeks for technical and communications failures.
On Monday, the state’s Public Utilities Commission ordered a review of the use and execution of the shut-off strategy.
California’s power shut-offs were intended to reduce the risk of fire.
But they have also cut power to many cellphone towers, depriving many people in harm’s way of their main means of communication.
An estimated one-quarter of the 436 cellphone towers were without power in Sonoma County, where the Kincade fire forced 180,000 residents to evacuate over the weekend, according to the Federal Communications Commission.
More than half of the 280 towers in nearby Marin County were also out of service, the F.C.C. said.
Most of the outages were related to pre-emptive power cuts imposed by Pacific Gas &
Electric, the state’s largest utility.
“You don’t appreciate how essential cellphone service is until you lose it,” said Chris Ungson, deputy director for communications and water policy for the California Public Advocate’s Office, an independent agency within the state’s Public Utilities Commission.
“It’s not just a matter of inconvenience;
it’s a matter of public health and safety.
It’s a lifeline to many, many people.
” A brush fire that broke out early Monday morning on the western side of Los Angeles quickly consumed 600 acres, created gridlock on the 405, the nation’s busiest highway, and resulted in mandatory evacuations.
But no fatalities were reported by midafternoon.
The fire, known as the Getty fire, forced officials to seal off main interchanges of the 405 by midmorning.
Offramps through the Sepulveda Pass, near where the fire started, were closed.
The growing blaze caused the Los Angeles Unified School District, the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District and many private schools to close before classes were to begin.
The University of California, Los Angeles and Santa Monica College also canceled classes.
“This is a fire that quickly spread,” Mayor Eric M. Garcetti of Los Angeles said at a news conference shortly after 7 a.m. local time.
“It is now over 500 acres, but we luckily had a lot of amazing heroes that were in our fire stations who rolled out immediately.
.
” By noon, more than 1,100 firefighters from around the region were assigned to the fire, according to Ralph M. Terrazas, the chief of the Los Angeles Fire Department.
He said that at least five houses had been lost and that he expected that number to rise.
The cause of the fire is under investigation.
The Getty fire, which was reported to emergency responders at 1:34 a.m. in a 911 call, prompted an emergency declaration from Mr. Garcetti.
Neighborhoods covered by mandatory evacuation orders include Brentwood, Mountaingate and West Los Angeles.
In all, more than 10,000 residential and commercial structures are in the evacuation zones.
Among the evacuees was the Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James.
“Had to emergency evacuate my house and I’ve been driving around with my family trying to get rooms,” he said in a Twitter message.
Residents in the Bay Area and Los Angeles complained of poor air quality on Monday because of the smoke from wildfires.
Experts say the best thing to do is to stay indoors with the windows closed and the air-conditioner set to recirculate.
If you have to venture outside, a mask may help, but not just any mask — you need to have the right type, and use it properly.

The Los Angeles Fire Department dispatched crews to protect the Getty Center, home to priceless artworks and a new exhibition of Edouard Manet’s paintings.
Capt.
Erik Scott, a department spokesman, said the Getty Center, a billion-dollar complex in Los Angeles that houses an art museum with works by Rembrandt, van Gogh, Monet and Degas, was not immediately threatened by the blaze.
[ A 2017 fire near the Getty Center destroyed six homes and damaged many others. Read about it here and here.] Peter Sanders, another spokesman for the department, said the center was surrounded by firefighters, as air tankers dropped red fire retardant on canyons to the west, ahead of the advancing fire, to create a barrier.
“There’s no longer an imminent threat to the Getty Center,” he said.
[Read about why the Getty Center, with its extensive art collection, stays put despite its location in a fire-prone area.
] Coffey Park, a neighborhood in Santa Rosa that was almost entirely destroyed in the Wine Country fires of two years ago, has been rebuilt, a remarkable transformation from field of rubble to idyllic California subdivision.
But now, with the front lines of the Kincade fire just a few miles away, residents live in a state of anxiety.
Samaz and Stefan Kiesbye moved back to the neighborhood in August after an arduous and costly rebuilding of their house.
A suitcase is packed, and sits by the door, awaiting the moment when they may have to flee once more.
The couple have gathered their marriage certificate and a stack of other documents, and packed two paintings that they cherish.
“It feels like an incremental apocalypse,” Mr. Kiesbye said on Monday.
“You can’t really sleep, because you are constantly getting up to read alerts.
It’s so exhausting.
” When they fled in 2017, they had only minutes to gather their passports and some electronics.
Everything they own now is new — and threatened once again by fire.
“It’s a constant struggle of being vigilant,” Mr. Kiesbye said.
“It slowly eats away at you.
” A neighbor put a lawn sprinkler on his roof two days ago, and then left.
It has been spraying water ever since.
A few doors down, another neighbor was in his driveway on Monday, warily surveying the smoke in the sky.
“I’m moving to a snow cave in Montana if this place burns again,” he said.
The Kincade fire in the heart of Sonoma County, north of San Francisco, doubled in size in 24 hours and was 15 percent contained on Monday evening.
The fire has now burned more than 74,000 acres, an area more than twice the size of the city of San Francisco, which covers 47 square miles.
More than 100 buildings have been destroyed by the fire, and 20 more damaged, according to Cal Fire, the state firefighting agency.
The fire threatens 90,000 buildings across an evacuation zone that includes a warning, but not an order, for part of neighboring Napa County.
Some 4,150 firefighters were battling the blaze as of Monday afternoon, Cal Fire said.
Two firefighters sustained burns, and one of them was airlifted to U.C.
Davis Medical Center for treatment, the authorities said.
High winds over the weekend helped to drive the rapid growth of the fire, and more high winds are in the forecast for Tuesday night through Thursday, the National Weather Service said on Monday.
All 40 Sonoma County public school districts and eight independent charter schools in the county have closed through Tuesday because of the uncertain availability of power, evacuations of students and staff, fire threats and air quality concerns, county officials announced.
Classes were also canceled at the University of California, Berkeley;
California State University Maritime Academy in Vallejo;
Dominican University of California in San Rafael;
Santa Rosa Junior College;
and Sonoma State University in Rohnert Park.
Thomas Fuller, the San Francisco bureau chief of The New York Times, writes from his home in the East Bay.
He lost power, along with hundreds of thousands of others.
At my house 25 miles from San Francisco in the hills of the East Bay, I woke up this morning at 4:30, walked with a flashlight across a spaghetti tangle of extension cords in the hallway and slipped into the backyard to turn on the generator.
Nothing works in the house without it.
Across Northern California on Monday around two million people were out of power.
Only some of us were lucky enough to have a fallback.
As the Kincade fire in Wine Country forced the evacuation of nearly 200,000 people over the weekend, residents farther south scrambled to find gasoline.
My neighbors messaged each other about which roads were safe to take to avoid the half-dozen spot fires that ignited in our area.
In the town adjacent to mine, Lafayette, a fire destroyed a sports facility and threatened a hillside neighborhood.
Another fire near the Carquinez Bridge shut down an interstate.
At one point on Sunday, four fires were burning simultaneously within 20 miles of my house.
On Monday morning the smell of smoke filled every room of my house.
The ferocious winds that propelled the fires bent saplings in half and knocked down mature trees, blocking a road near my house and injuring several people at a farmers’ market in nearby Martinez.
I’ve noticed that neighbors are using the word apocalyptic much more casually these days.
The winds, which in some cases reached hurricane-level speeds, added to a feeling of chaos and powerlessness.
At night, neighborhoods without power look eerily uninhabited.
We have taken for granted the convenience of flipping on a light switch or of checking email.
In the bedroom communities of San Francisco and Silicon Valley, the fires and blackouts have turned assumptions upside down.
Pharmacies, supermarkets and restaurants are closed during the blackouts.
On Sunday even the open space around us was closed — the regional park district announced it was off-limits because of extreme winds.
We filled our bathtub after warnings that the water utility may need to shut down its pumps.
One man said he had tried to go to six gas stations, all of them closed.
The extraordinary is becoming routine.
Pacific Gas &
Electric says it may shut off power again this week, starting on Tuesday when strong winds are expected to return.
Pacific Gas &
Electric, whose equipment is suspected in the Kincade fire, told state regulators Monday that its lines, poles or transformers might have been involved in three other blazes.
Two of the fires occurred within about an hour of each other late Sunday afternoon in Lafayette, east of Berkeley.
In one case, the company said, Contra Costa Fire Department workers told a PG&
E employee at the site that they were looking into contact between a PG&
E wire and a communications cable “as a potential ignition source.
” In the second fire, a PG&
E worker found a fallen pole and transformer nearby, and county fire personnel said they were looking at the transformer as a possible cause of the blaze.
High winds were reported at the time, and local news reports said a tennis club had been heavily damaged in one of the fires, which prompted a brief evacuation.
In the third incident, on Sunday evening, a PG&
E crew found a wire down in Milpitas, north of San Jose, near the site of a fire that damaged two houses, two cars and a shed.
A Milpitas fire investigator told a PG&
E worker that the downed wire could have started the fire and collected part of a conductor as evidence.
None of the fires occurred in areas where pre-emptive power cuts — known as public safety power shut-offs — had been imposed by PG&
E.
Nearly three million people were affected Sunday by the largest fire-prevention blackouts in California history.
PG&
E officials said the company notified 500,000 customers in Northern California on Sunday that they might face a new round of power shut-offs on Tuesday, affecting many of the same areas that were blacked out over the weekend.
The new round would be the fourth time this month that the company has intentionally turned off electricity to large numbers of customers, some of whom had power for only a few hours between earlier blackouts.
[The New York Times has photographers on the ground documenting the Kincade fire and the struggle to contain it. Follow their work here. ] Adam Sobel, an atmospheric scientist and director of the Initiative on Extreme Weather and Climate at Columbia University, gives an explanation: This increasingly awful fall fire season follows hard on the previous two, in 2017 and 2018, both of which were worse than any in recent memory.
Some of the same regions, and people, are being affected repeatedly in quick succession.
Psychic trauma is surely compounded significantly for these residents, not to mention the firefighters on the front lines.
How should California residents think about the future, when the present is, suddenly and persistently, not only far outside their prior experience, but also, in its scale and velocity at least, beyond what science had predicted?
It’s an increasingly common experience, occurring with other kinds of events as well.
Heavy rain events are becoming heavier around the world, but known climate trends can’t explain the repeated 500-or-more-year floods that Houston has seen in the last few years.
In the case of the increasingly frequent wildfire disasters in California, I argued the other day that they have multiple causes: poor maintenance by PG&
E, expanded human settlement at the margins of fire-prone woodlands, and global warming.
But I don’t think any of them explains either the suddenness or the persistence of the change that Californians have experienced in the last three years.
When it comes to the weather, and the climate, my views here are strongly informed by discussions with my colleague Park Williams, an expert on wildfire and climate whose research is directly relevant.
That research shows that the area burned by fires each year in the summer months has increased drastically, and this is consistent with the influence expected from global warming.
But, as explained by Dr. Williams in his recent research article, and in The Times on Friday, the headline-making fires of the last three years have all occurred in fall.
In that season, temperature has a role, but other factors are likely to be more important — first and foremost, the dry Diablo and Santa Ana winds.
Those are mainly fall and winter phenomena, and clearly critical factors in the recent and current fires.
But these winds are actually projected to occur less frequently as the climate warms (with no clear trend yet apparent in the observations).
So the fires may be attributable to weather, but the most critical aspect of the weather isn’t directly attributable to human activity — nor, as far as I can tell, to any other identifiable larger cause.
So what is going on?
My guess is that the best scientific answer goes something like this.
The sparking might have gotten worse over time.
But more important, in the last three years, it has encountered the hot, dry downslope winds markedly more often.
And global warming is probably making those winds a little hotter, but the wind events themselves, the most important proximate causes, may well be only explainable, ultimately, as “natural variability.
” That means they are inherently unpredictable.
Bad luck, in other words.
If this is true, it would suggest a decent chance that next year shouldn’t be as bad.
Or maybe the causes are in principle knowable, but current science just doesn’t know them.
Maybe climate change is proceeding more rapidly and dangerously than we understand.
But it’s good to understand what the limits of our knowledge are.
That should keep us humble about our place on the earth.

69,1919840,"['united states', 'states leading', 'leading source', 'source coronavirus', 'coronavirus cases', 'followed by italy', 'italy then china']","The fear and suspicion directed at China in the devastating early days of the coronavirus outbreak have made a 180-degree turn: It is the West that now frightens Asia and the rest of the world.
With Italy, Spain and the United States surging in contagion, many countries in Asia that suffered through the pandemic first seem to have wrestled it into submission, particularly China — and are now fighting to protect against a new wave of infection from outside.
Across Asia, travelers from Europe and the United States are being barred or forced into quarantine.
Gyms, private clinics and restaurants in Hong Kong warn them to stay away.
Even Chinese parents who proudly sent their children to study in New York or London are now mailing them masks and sanitizer or rushing them home on flights that can cost $25,000.
“We came back because we think going back to China is safer than staying in New York,” said Farrah Lyu, a 24-year-old recent college graduate who flew home to eastern China with her roommate this month.
The reversal of fortune would have been unimaginable a week ago.
At the time, China was the outbreak’s global epicenter, with people dying by the hundreds each day.
But on Thursday, it reported no new local cases for the first time since the outbreak began.
Its uncompromising response — locking down cities, shutting factories, testing thousands — seems to have brought China’s contagion under control.
Now the pandemic that originated in China is migrating and starting to recirculate.
Across Asia, where Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea successfully grappled with the virus early, alongside China, there is a growing sense of fear and dismay.
Much of the region looks west and asks: We’re getting it right — why can’t you?
For President Trump, the answer has been deflection.
Facing a torrent of criticism for playing down the epidemic in its crucial early stages, he has been trying to push blame back to China, worsening existing tensions between the two superpowers.
Despite warnings that he is encouraging xenophobia, Mr. Trump has repeatedly used the term “China virus” in what critics see as an effort to distance himself from the problem.
Beijing has retaliated by falsely suggesting that the virus started with American troops, while portraying itself as a heroic warrior against the contagion and a model for the world.
Especially in China and the Chinese diaspora, there is a growing demand for recognition of the hard work and sacrifices that tamed the outbreak, and a desire to tell the world what has gone right and wrong, and why.
“People in Western countries said China’s response was too authoritarian, didn’t respect people’s democracy and freedom enough,” said Yin Choi Lam, a Vietnamese-Chinese restaurant owner in Melbourne, Australia.
“Now compare it to places like Italy, where the death rate is so high, or America, where no one knows how many people are sick.
Would you rather have freedom or keep your life?” Similar arguments are flooding Chinese social media.
One popular comic shows China sick as the world watches behind a glass barrier, followed by a panel with an angry, healthy China behind the glass as other countries play and tussle without masks like unruly children.
Some of the heaviest scorn, however, has been saved for those who return to China and question the country’s harsh approach.
A video that went viral this week showed a Chinese-Australian woman being confronted by the police in Beijing after she evaded quarantine in order to exercise.
Users of the microblogging platform Weibo called for her to be sent back to Australia.
Critics both inside and outside China note that the country’s authoritarian response is not the only or the best way to fight an epidemic.
Officials kept the virus secret for weeks, allowing it to spread uncontrolled in central China, then forced people to remain in overwhelmed cities.
By contrast, South Korea, a vibrant capitalist democracy, along with Taiwan and Singapore, has managed the virus with transparency, efficiency and solidarity, while preserving freedom of movement.
Part of what has set some Asian countries apart is experience, said Leighanne Yuh, a historian at Korea University.
“From the outset of the epidemic, South Koreans took the situation very seriously, perhaps because of their previous experiences with SARS and MERS,” she said.
“Wearing masks, washing our hands, social distancing — these were all familiar actions.
” In the United States and Europe, there was more hesitation.
And now they are hubs of infection sending disease across the globe.
In Australia, the United States is now the leading source of coronavirus cases, followed by Italy, then China.
Infections in China are also coming from outside.
Officials said on Thursday that 34 new cases had been confirmed among people who had arrived from elsewhere.
Many people in China now want their government to completely block access from the United States and other hot spots in the same way other countries suspended arrivals from China.
“I hope China can tighten its national borders and significantly reduce the number of people entering the country,” said Tang Xiaozhao, a plastic surgery manager in Shanghai.
Updated September 1, 2020 “Governments and people of most countries disappoint me,” she added.
Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory, has often acted as a bridge between China and the West, and the shifting sense of angst can be seen in warnings from businesses where people gather.
One online warning, posted by a pub called Hemingway’s DB, tells expats that they will be reported to the police if they violate a new official requirement for 14 days of self-isolation upon returning from overseas.
And a large fitness chain emailed customers to tell anyone who has returned from abroad since March 10, or lives with someone who did: “Kindly do not visit.
” For those with family members in the United States or Europe, there is also a frantic rush to help.
On Wednesday at Hong Kong’s main post office, people lined up to send boxes of masks and alcohol wipes.
“During SARS, my mother drove from Canada to the United States to buy masks, so I had to send some back to her,” said Eric Chan, 45, a financier.
He was down to his last box in Hong Kong, but had gone from pharmacy to pharmacy until he snagged a few boxes for his mother and siblings at inflated prices.
His own face was covered — most people in Hong Kong are still wearing masks.
The city, with a population of seven million, has avoided total shutdowns, even as the virus peaked in mainland China.
But this week Hong Kong moved to tighten its borders as it recorded a significant uptick in infections, most of them imported.
The authorities are investigating five cases linked to Lan Kwai Fong, a nightlife area that is thronged with expatriates on weekends.
Many of those who recently returned to China might have predicted just such a cluster.
They see in the United States and Europe a greater urge to go it alone — and studies have found that Americans and Europeans tend to focus on the individual rather than what’s interconnected.
Ms. Lyu, 24, and her roommate in New York, Tianran Qian, 23 — who flew back to their homes in Hangzhou, in eastern China — said they found the American response disorienting.
They had both been reading about outbreak clusters around the world for weeks, and for a time they stayed inside and wore masks as they would have at home.
But their American friends continued to socialize, describing the virus as little more than the flu.
“On your phone, you see what’s happening around the world, in Japan and Korea, and when you go into real life, people act as if it’s a normal day,” Ms. Lyu said, describing what it was like in New York before she left.
“They either don’t get it or they just ignore it,” Ms. Qian said.
“People were so indifferent.
” At home in China, they said, they felt safer.
They self-quarantined in their rooms, with their parents leaving food and novels at their bedroom doors.
Their groceries were delivered and even their trash was collected and treated by hospital employees in hazmat suits.
“Everything was planned,” Ms. Lyu said.
“We don’t have to worry about everything.

But their American friends continued to socialize, describing the virus as little more than the flu.
“On your phone, you see what’s happening around the world, in Japan and Korea, and when you go into real life, people act as if it’s a normal day,” Ms. Lyu said, describing what it was like in New York before she left.
“They either don’t get it or they just ignore it,” Ms. Qian said.
“People were so indifferent.
” At home in China, they said, they felt safer.
They self-quarantined in their rooms, with their parents leaving food and novels at their bedroom doors.
Their groceries were delivered and even their trash was collected and treated by hospital employees in hazmat suits.
“Everything was planned,” Ms. Lyu said.
“We don’t have to worry about everything.

70,1892270,"['texas', 'american airlines', 'airlines flight', 'health officals', 'flight attendants', 'Dr Lofy']","SEATTLE — Health officials in Brazos County, Texas, said Thursday that they were investigating a suspected case of Wuhan coronavirus and were keeping a patient isolated at home as they did additional testing.
The patient had traveled from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak of the respiratory illness began, and health care providers determined that the patient met the criteria for coronavirus testing, officials said.
They said they would promptly announce if testing confirmed the patient’s illness is a case of Wuhan coronavirus.
The United States identified its first confirmed Wuhan coronavirus patient in Washington State earlier this week after a man who had traveled to the Wuhan region became sick and sought medical attention.
Officials have been working to contact people who were on his flight home and are monitoring 16 people they have identified as having had close contact with that patient in recent days.
While assuring the public that there was little threat, officials said Wednesday that they also believed it would not be the last Wuhan coronavirus case to reach the United States.
The strain of coronavirus surfaced in December and has spread through parts of Asia, sickening hundreds and killing at least 17 people.
The authorities in China have since closed off Wuhan, a city of more than 11 million people, by canceling flights and trains leaving the city, and suspending bus, subway and ferry service within it.
Travel restrictions have been extended to several cities nearby.
The United States has implemented its own travel limits, funneling passengers who have traveled recently to Wuhan through a handful of airports, including Los Angeles International, that have special screening processes in place.
","SEATTLE — A Texas A&
M University student was being isolated at home on Thursday as health officials said they were examining whether he could be the second known case of Wuhan coronavirus in the United States.
The man had traveled from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak of the respiratory illness began, and health care providers determined that he met the criteria for coronavirus testing, health officials in Brazos County, Texas, said.
They said they would promptly announce if testing confirmed the patient’s illness was a case of Wuhan coronavirus.
Texas A&
M said in a statement that the immediate health risk to those on its campus in College Station was considered low.
The case marked a growing roster of people being monitored around the United States since officials identified the country’s first confirmed Wuhan coronavirus patient in Washington State this week.
Officials have been working to contact people who were on his flight home from the Wuhan region, and on Thursday they increased the number of people they have identified as having had close contact with that patient in recent days to
43. Those people will get daily check-ins from medical personnel to monitor their health.
Separately, the state’s health officer, Dr. Kathy Lofy, said in an interview that officials have started investigating a few other individuals in the state to determine whether they may have the coronavirus strain.
While assuring the public that there was little threat, officials have said the patient in Washington State would most likely not be the last Wuhan coronavirus case to reach the United States.
Dr. Lofy encouraged people to take typical steps that could prevent the spread of illnesses, such as washing hands and avoiding touching their eyes, nose and mouth.
“Currently, we believe the risk to the general public is low,” Dr. Lofy said.

Travel restrictions have been extended to several cities nearby.
The United States has put travel limits of its own in place, funneling passengers who have traveled recently to Wuhan through a handful of airports, including Los Angeles International, that have special screening processes in place.
A passenger who arrived at Los Angeles International on an American Airlines flight from Mexico City on Wednesday night was taken to a hospital for a “precautionary medical evaluation,” officials said.
Heath Montgomery, an airport spokesman, said he did not know whether the traveler had recently been to China or whether coronavirus was suspected.
State and county health officials declined to discuss the situation in detail, but said they did not have any confirmed cases of coronavirus.
They have been providing healthy travelers arriving from Wuhan with information about symptoms and advising them to seek care if they become ill.
Updated August 6, 2020 The union that represents more than 27,000 American Airlines flight attendants on Thursday called for airlines to institute immediate emergency measures, including procedures to manage potentially ill people.
Lori Bassani, the national president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said airlines needed to do everything possible to contain the outbreak and minimize the chances of exposure.
“The health of our crew members and passengers is a top priority for us and we refuse to compromise their health or safety in any way,” Ms. Bassani said.

— John Palmer, a former university professor, has always had a cause.
For decades he urged Minnesota officials to face the dangers of drunken driving and embrace seatbelts.
Now he has a new goal: curbing the resettlement of Somali refugees in St. Cloud, after a few thousand moved into this small city where Mr. Palmer has lived for decades.
Every weekday, he sits in the same spot at Culver’s restaurant — the corner booth near the Kwik Trip — and begins his daily intake of news from xenophobic and conspiratorial sites, such as JihadWatch.org, and articles with titles like “Lifting the Veil on the ‘Islamophobia’ Hoax.
” On Thursdays, Mr. Palmer hosts a group called Concerned Community Citizens, or C-Cubed, which he formed to pressure local officials over the Muslim refugees.
Mr. Palmer said at a recent meeting he viewed them as innately less intelligent than the “typical” American citizen, as well as a threat.
“The very word ‘Islamophobia’ is a false narrative,” Mr. Palmer, 70, said.
“A phobia is an irrational fear.
” Raising his voice, he added, “An irrational fear!
There are many reasons we are not being irrational.
” In this predominantly white region of central Minnesota, the influx of Somalis, most of whom are Muslim, has spurred the sort of demographic and cultural shifts that President Trump and right-wing conservatives have stoked fears about for years.
The resettlement has divided many politically active residents of St. Cloud, with some saying they welcome the migrants.
But for others, the changes have fueled talk about “white replacement,” a racist conspiracy theory tied to the declining birthrates of white Americans that has spread in far-right circles and online chat rooms and is now surfacing in some communities.
“If we start changing our way of life to accommodate where they came from, guess what happens to our country?” said Liz Baklaich, a member of C-Cubed who unsuccessfully ran for St. Cloud City Council last year.
She carries an annotated Quran in her purse.
“If our country becomes like Somalia, there is nowhere for us to go.
” [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Minnesota’s biggest city, Minneapolis, has long struggled to incorporate a growing immigrant population into the city’s fabric, but the recent ascension of some former refugees into political power was taken as a sign of progress by many liberals.
In central Minnesota, which is more conservative than the state’s urban centers, advocates for refugees fear that the resettlements could be met with more resistance.
Dave Kleis, the Republican mayor of St. Cloud, has voiced support for the resettlement program, but he has also drawn criticism for not forcefully denouncing groups like C-Cubed, which he refused to discuss in an interview.
Mr. Kleis said the city was facing the same challenges as other parts of Minnesota and other changing communities around the country.
St. Cloud, the state’s 10th-largest city, increased in population by 33 percent over the last 30 years, to roughly 70,000 people.
The share of nonwhite residents grew to 18 percent from 2 percent, mostly with East African immigrants from Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia, and the numbers of Somalis are estimated to grow.
Their increased presence — and an attack at a mall in 2016, when Dahir Adan, a Somali-American refugee living in St. Cloud, stabbed 10 people — has emboldened a loosely connected network of white, anti-immigration activists who are trying to pressure local and state Republicans to embrace an increasingly explicit anti-Muslim agenda.
Across the state, this network includes conservative radio hosts, think tanks and digital media that focus on anti-refugee news in Minnesota, as well as small community groups like C-Cubed, which repeatedly invite anti-Muslim speakers to town, leading to clashes and protests.
Formed in 2017 to support more nativist candidates on the City Council, C-Cubed is a small group of only about a dozen members, but its existence has already changed the city’s political landscape.
C-Cubed supported four candidates for City Council last year, and two won seats, although Mr. Palmer himself lost.
Members say they are raising questions about the state’s refugee program in order to determine its total cost.
But in interviews, many repeatedly outlined more fundamental fears, including the belief that an influx of people who were nonwhite and non-Christian posed a cultural threat.
Several of the group’s members and their allies said their stand against immigration was a small part of a broader national conflict, in which the rising tide of a multicultural, multiracial Democratic Party must be opposed.
Kim Crockett, the vice president and general counsel of a conservative Minnesota think tank called the Center of the American Experiment, said she intended to eventually sue the state and challenge the resettlement program in court.
“I think of America, the great assimilator, as a rubber band, but with this — we’re at the breaking point,” Ms. Crockett said.
“These aren’t people coming from Norway, let’s put it that way.
These people are very visible.
” Though it predates Mr. Trump, the opposition to migrant resettlement among some Minnesotans has been invigorated by the president, who has repeatedly demeaned refugees and Muslims, and who recently announced a restrictive immigration proposal that included cultural provisions such as preferential treatment for English speakers.
In St. Cloud, some opponents of the refugee program have taken the introduction of non-pork options in the local public schools as an attack on their way of life.
The 2018 elections of Representative Ilhan Omar and Attorney General Keith Ellison, who are Muslim, fueled xenophobic conspiracies that Muslim residents were planning a long-term coup to institute Shariah Law.
They also point to individual instances of crime by Somali-Americans as proof of an innate predisposition to violence, and ignore the repeated studies showing that there is no demonstrated link between immigrants and criminal behavior.
Catholic Charities, one of the providers who led the state’s refugee program, recently announced it would no longer be participating, saying it was focusing resources on homelessness and helping at-risk children.
This came after years of community pressure from conservatives — including a 2016 billboard in St. Cloud that read, “Catholic Charities Resettles Islamists: EVIL or INSANITY?” Paul Brandmire, a Republican member of the St. Cloud City Council who is skeptical about the resettlement program, said some white residents had come to see themselves in a fight for survival.
The refugees are “not leaving,” Mr. Brandmire said.
“They’re becoming American citizens.
And they have every right to, but this is killing us,” he continued.
“This is the Hatfields and McCoys.
” A 2018 poll from The Star Tribune of Minneapolis reported that almost 50 percent of Minnesota Republicans wanted the state to temporarily stop accepting refugees, and during the midterm elections the most prominent members of the state’s Republican ticket all pledged to institute a moratorium on resettlement.
A New York Times poll from 2018 showed the 8th Congressional District — in the state’s northern region — was one of the few areas where 50 percent of people said discrimination against white Americans had become as big a problem as discrimination against minority groups.
Earlier this year, at a Republican town hall in nearby Anoka County, an argument erupted between some residents and Representative Tom Emmer because he had not backed a bill that would designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group.
National Republicans have also pointed to Minnesota, and the two Democratic House seats that Republicans flipped there in a tough midterm election, as proof Mr. Trump’s brand of grievance politics has political potency that may be underrated in Washington.
In the days before the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Trump visited Minnesota to pitch a proposal to halt all resettlement of Syrian refugees to America, in what would eventually become his travel ban to seven countries, many of them with Muslim majorities.
“Here in Minnesota you have seen firsthand the problems caused with faulty refugee vetting, with large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state, without your knowledge, without your support or approval,” Mr. Trump said at a Minneapolis rally at the time.
“You’ve suffered enough in Minnesota.
” Two years ago in St. Cloud, Jeff Johnson, a city councilman, introduced a resolution that would temporarily halt refugee resettlement until a study of its economic impact was completed.
The idea arose, Mr. Johnson said, after he spoke by phone with officials from the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, an anti-immigration firm that has gained influence in the Trump era.
The resolution was defeated, but its introduction caused significant uproar in St. Cloud, and pushed some residents to form or join opposing community groups.
Among them was a pro-refugee organization, #UniteCloud, that has become a prominent force in trying to build relationships and a sense of community across demographics.
Natalie Ringsmuth, a white St. Cloud resident who formed the #UniteCloud group, said Mr. Trump had “made people feel bold in not being ‘Minnesota nice’ anymore.
” Ms. Ringsmuth runs a website that highlights positive stories about the city’s refugee community, and recently made a welcome video that asks local immigrants questions like, “What do you want people to know about Muslim women?” “Things are fraught.
And they’re fraught not only in St. Cloud, but in central Minnesota,” Ms. Ringsmuth said.
“What might have been talked about only in kitchen tables or small groups is now prime conversation for the public.
” Bob Carrillo, a former radio host who lives in St. Michael, Minn.
, and has gained prominence for his anti-immigrant stance, said Mr. Trump had given voice to the concerns of “longtime Minnesotans.
” At a coffee shop in St. Cloud, Mr. Carrillo also set a framed picture of his white grandchildren on the center of the table, meant to amplify the emotional impact of his xenophobic thesis: that Muslims pose an existential threat to the safety of his family.
“They’re 2 percent of the population right now, and in 5 to 10 years they’ll be at 5 percent,” Mr. Carrillo said.
“At that point, we’re done for.
” Mr. Kleis, the city’s mayor, sees it differently.
He lauded the community-building activities the region has undertaken, which includes get-to-know-your-neighbor potlucks at the local library and citywide surveys asking “Is St. Cloud a friendly community?” The local newspaper, The St. Cloud Times, ran a series of fact checks to debunk myths about refugees and immigrants.
“I’d rather focus on building community than being reactionary,” he said.
Jaylani Hussein, the executive director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Minnesota, said St. Cloud was the “epicenter” of anti-Muslim sentiment in the state.
Mr. Hussein condemned people like Mr. Kleis and other members of the Republican Party, who he said had been too neutral as xenophobia festered within their ranks.
“For me, the saddest part is that the majority of people in the St. Cloud region are good people who refused to step up,” Mr. Hussein said.
“But it’s the fact that they don’t want to get involved and makes it seem like St. Cloud is all a bunch of people who accept this.
” Ekram Elmoge, a 21-year-old who resettled in St. Cloud from Somalia about five years ago, described the city as “diversity without inclusion.
” Ms. Elmoge said she had been harassed by white residents, who have yelled, “Go back to your country” and “You’re here for free money.
” She is currently enrolled at St. Cloud State University, where Mr. Palmer used to be a professor.
“It’s hard to be accepted for who you are,” Ms. Elmoge said.
“The people here who have accepted me have been white.
But the people who have not accepted me are also white.
They say ‘go back to your country’ and ‘you make St. Cloud a bad place to live.
’” In interviews, the C-Cubed members and allies remain undeterred, and they are setting their sights on helping Republicans make gains in the 2020 election.
At one of the group’s events last year, some residents donned hats that read “Make St. Cloud Great Again” for a “Red Hat forum,” where local law enforcement officers and national anti-Muslim speakers were invited.
Similar speakers have been invited to a local church, Granite City Baptist, a mostly white congregation on the city’s west side.
During a meeting of about 10 C-Cubed members in April at the Faith Lutheran Church in St. Cloud, Mr. Palmer steered a free-flowing discussion that began by comparing abortion access to the Holocaust and moved on to the city’s so-called refugee problem, and what the group could do to address it.
Almost all of those present voiced some support for Mr. Trump.
Others said that markers of progress were more interpersonal, and they would only be comfortable in their community if the Somali-born refugees converted to Christianity.
One woman, who declined to give her name after the group discussion, bemoaned the city’s so-called no-go zones, or the areas where white residents said they felt so uncomfortable with the Somali-American presence that they would not return — a shopping mall, a community housing center and Beaver Island Trail, a hiking area that borders the Mississippi River.
“They were just —” she said, searching for the words to describe the offending behavior of the Somali-Americans.
“They were just walking around.

72,1717936,"['New York', 'inbox', 'need to know', 'start the day']","From its Lower Manhattan headquarters three blocks north of Wall Street, an unlikely city agency seemed to be ramping up for battle.
It bought 140 Glock 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistols.
It spent $155,000 on ammunition, $140,000 on body armor, more than $800,000 on two-way radios and $54,000 for night-vision goggles.
There were discussions about buying assault rifles and even acquiring a decommissioned police boat.
Such an approach might be standard procedure for a front-line law enforcement agency like the Police Department, but it wasn’t exactly typical for the city’s Department of Investigation.
The agency is charged with investigating waste, corruption and mismanagement in city government, where it has traditionally focused, in large measure, on white-collar crime.
None of its employees have been shot at or assaulted in the line of duty, according to the agency, and officials could not recall a single instance in which an employee had fired a gun at a crime suspect.
But with little public discussion or oversight, Mark G. Peters, who was fired last month from his post as investigation commissioner, transformed the character of the agency, turning it into an armed force under his command.
Mr. Peters, who had clashed with Mayor Bill de Blasio throughout his tenure, was fired by the mayor after an independent investigator found that he retaliated against an office whistle-blower and was “cavalier with the truth.
” The investigation stemmed from a move by Mr. Peters to seize control over a quasi-independent schools investigation office.
When the office’s chief investigator, Anastasia Coleman, questioned his authority to do so, Mr. Peters fired her.
She filed a whistle-blower complaint, leading to a report that found that Mr. Peters acted “in a manner indicating a lack of concern for following the law.
” Now, with Mr. Peters out, his transformation of the agency, including the role of its armed officers, is being reviewed by his successor, Margaret Garnett, a former federal prosecutor and most recently New York State’s executive deputy attorney general.
When Mr. Peters became commissioner in 2014, the agency owned no handguns.
It had 75 designated peace officers with weapons permits (all of whom owned their own weapons), but their role in the agency was not emphasized.
Mr. Peters changed all that.
He spent $45,000 in federal forfeiture money to acquire a small arsenal of Glock handguns.
He purchased 760,000 rounds of ammunition.
He expanded the peace officer program, creating an academy within the agency to train and certify the peace officers, including through courses in weapons use and self-defense techniques.
And as the agency grew under Mr. Peters, roughly doubling in size to more than 400 employees, the number of peace officers proportionally rose to 148.
Mr. Peters, whose tenure was not without its successes, including hard-charging investigations that exposed serious flaws in city government like failures in lead paint inspections in public housing and shortcomings in the police department’s sex crimes unit, defended the spending.
He said that any law enforcement agency needed to protect its agents.
“Are you suggesting it would have been better if we sent people out without bulletproof vests?” Mr. Peters said in an interview on Friday.
“The N.Y.P.D. provides weapons to its officers.
We are an independent law enforcement agency, among other things tasked with looking at the N.Y.P.D.
For us to send people out into the field ill-equipped would put them in danger and would be irresponsible.
” Mr. Peters had also arranged for the city to find new, bigger offices to house his growing agency, and then insisted on a menu of costly upgrades that he justified as being needed for law enforcement purposes: an indoor running track, a room with a reinforced floor for self-defense training, a room for a firearms training simulator, a gym with fitness equipment and an ammunition storage room fortified by bulletproof walls and glass.
The additional construction cost of the upgrades was nearly $3 million, according to the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, which handles city real estate.
Mr. Peters said the nature of the agency’s work required investigators to receive skill and safety training roughly the equivalent of what the Police Department provides for its officers.
“You don’t want people without good training going out into the field doing criminal investigations, especially when we were expanding the work we were doing in places like Rikers Island,” Mr. Peters said.
“We suddenly were now charged with dealing with the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which included a lot of work with narcotics pill mills.
Some of this is dangerous work and it needs to be done by people who are properly trained.
” Mr. Peters was able to act largely under the radar to arm and outfit his agency because the funds came from federal forfeiture money from the CityTime corruption scandal, a massive white-collar crime spree involving the modernization of the city’s payroll system.
About six months before Mr. Peters became commissioner, the Investigation Department received $27 million in federal forfeiture funds related to CityTime, and the agency has been drawing down on that amount ever since.
From mid-2014 through mid-2017, the agency spent a total of $13.7 million in forfeiture money.
The largest expenditures went to expanded office space, computer hardware and software, and vehicles.
But the money was also used to equip the agency’s growing force of peace officers.
Spending for guns, ammunition, bulletproof vests, gym equipment, a firearms training simulator, radios, night vision gear and ceremonial uniforms totaled more than $1.3 million, according to the agency.
The agency has broad discretion in how it spends forfeiture money, which lacks the sort of scrutiny given to money allocated through the city budget.
The department is required to make annual reports about the spending to the federal government, but they contain almost no detail to show exactly how the money was spent.
The federal reports were signed by Mr. Peters and Mayor de Blasio, but Eric F. Phillips, the mayor’s press secretary, said that the mayor was not aware of the specifics of the spending “since D.O.I. maintains a large measure of managerial and administrative independence.
” “The mayor was supportive of D.O.I. growing and doing more, but he wasn’t micromanaging the equipment purchases,” Mr. Phillips said in an emailed statement.
Mr. Peters also took steps to heighten the importance of the armed peace officers within the agency.
He issued an order mandating that in most cases, only armed peace officers could leave the agency’s office in Lower Manhattan to conduct interviews as part of investigations, a change that troubled some veteran investigators who had not undergone weapons training and considered it an unnecessary limitation on their work.
Mr. Peters also spent more than $100,000 to dress his troops in uniforms, including duty uniforms for day-to-day work and ceremonial uniforms for special occasions.
Ms. Struzzi said that the changes were done as part of an effort to professionalize the peace officer program, improve training and safety and better prepare the department to carry out its law enforcement duties.
She said that the new academy, created in 2015, includes a 14-week program with more rigorous and standardized training.
Yet there was little public discussion of these changes at the agency and whether or not they were necessary, such as weapons purchases and the emphasis on arming investigators.
“Commissioner Garnett and her executives are currently evaluating D.O.I.’s policies and procedures, including those associated with the peace officers,” said the department’s director of communications, Diane Struzzi.
Ms. Struzzi acknowledged that the agency had also discussed acquiring assault weapons, such as the AR-15, “due to D.O.I.’s participation in task forces where long arms are used.
” She said that the weapons were not purchased and that Ms. Garnett had ruled out buying assault weapons.
She said that the agency had also considered acquiring a decommissioned police boat, at no cost, but never did so.
“D.O.I. oversees several city agencies that maintain a nautical fleet and the boat was intended to further its mission and expand its field operational capabilities,” Ms. Struzzi said.
There were indications that Mr. Peters relished the greater emphasis on armed officers.
A document prepared in April by the city’s Law Department said that Mr. Peters once telephoned the office of the city’s budget director and threatened to have his staff go to the official’s office “with ‘guns and handcuffs’ and bring him to a meeting.
” On another occasion, when Mr. Peters was angry over the pace of renovations for the agency’s new offices, he threatened a group of city officials and others “by stating that he had ‘people with guns in the room’ who could make arrests,” according to the law department.
Those allegations are now the subject of a city investigation.
In another series of incidents, Mr. Peters was accompanied by two armed peace officers when he told Ms. Coleman, the schools investigator, that she was fired, according to a report on the matter.
The next day he met with her staff to inform them of the firing.
According to people who were present, there were two armed peace officers posted at the conference room door.

] From its Lower Manhattan headquarters three blocks north of Wall Street, an unlikely city agency seemed to be ramping up for battle.
It bought 140 Glock 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistols.
It spent $155,000 on ammunition, $140,000 on body armor, more than $800,000 on two-way radios and $54,000 for night-vision goggles.
There were discussions about buying assault rifles and even acquiring a decommissioned police boat.
Such an approach might be standard procedure for a front-line law enforcement agency like the Police Department, but it wasn’t exactly typical for the city’s Department of Investigation.
The agency is charged with investigating waste, corruption and mismanagement in city government, where it has traditionally focused, in large measure, on white-collar crime.
None of its employees have been shot at or assaulted in the line of duty, according to the agency, and officials could not recall a single instance in which an employee had fired a gun at a crime suspect.
But with little public discussion or oversight, Mark G. Peters, who was fired last month from his post as investigation commissioner, transformed the character of the agency, turning it into an armed force under his command.
Mr. Peters, who had clashed with Mayor Bill de Blasio throughout his tenure, was fired by the mayor after an independent investigator found that he retaliated against an office whistle-blower and was “cavalier with the truth.
” The investigation stemmed from a move by Mr. Peters to seize control over a quasi-independent schools investigation office.
When the office’s chief investigator, Anastasia Coleman, questioned his authority to do so, Mr. Peters fired her.
She filed a whistle-blower complaint, leading to a report that found that Mr. Peters acted “in a manner indicating a lack of concern for following the law.
” Now, with Mr. Peters out, his transformation of the agency, including the role of its armed officers, is being reviewed by his successor, Margaret Garnett, a former federal prosecutor and most recently New York State’s executive deputy attorney general.

73,1757219,"['said', 'maintained']","The father of a Sandy Hook school shooting victim was found dead in an apparent suicide in Newtown, Conn.
, on Monday morning, the local police said.
Jeremy Richman, 49, was found dead at Edmond Town Hall, a movie theater and event space in Newtown, at about 7 a.m., according to Lt.
Aaron Bahamonde of the Newtown Police Department.
Mr. Richman was the father of Avielle Richman, one of the 20 children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012.
Some of the police officers who reported to the scene of his death on Monday also responded to that shooting, Lieutenant Bahamonde said.
“This is devastating to our community,” Lieutenant Bahamonde said.
“I can’t stress that enough.
” Following Avielle’s death, Mr. Richman and his wife, Jennifer Hensel, created the Avielle Foundation, a nonprofit focused on neuroscience research, with the goal of “exploring the underpinnings of the brain that lead to violent behaviors,” according to the foundation’s website.
The foundation had an office in Edmond Town Hall, where Mr. Richman was found dead.
The police were called to the building on Monday morning by contractors who were working there, Lieutenant Bahamonde said.
When they arrived, the police also found a note left by Mr. Richman.
Lieutenant Bahamonde did not disclose what the note said.
The police and the state’s medical examiner’s office were investigating the death, Lieutenant Bahamonde said.
Mr. Richman, a neuropharmacologist, earned a doctorate from the University of Arizona in 1992.
He also had an appointment as a faculty lecturer in psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine.
In 2016, Yale’s Department of Psychiatry honored Mr. Richman and Ms. Hensel with its Research Advocacy Award.
Mr. Richman and Ms. Hensel were among the Sandy Hook families who had filed lawsuits against the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, the host of Infowars, a radio show and website.
Mr. Jones has maintained that the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax.
The lawsuit involving Mr. Richman and Ms. Hensel claims that Mr. Jones embarked on a campaign of “abusive and outrageous false statements in which Jones and the other defendants have developed, amplified and perpetuated claims that the Sandy Hook massacre was staged and that the 26 families who lost loved ones that day are paid actors who faked their relatives’ deaths.
” On Twitter, Senator Christopher S. Murphy, the Connecticut Democrat who has emerged as a powerful voice against gun violence, called Mr. Richman’s death “devastating.
” “Jeremy was a good friend and an unceasing advocate for better research into the brain’s violence triggers,” Mr. Murphy wrote.
“He was with me in my office two weeks ago, excited as could be about the Avielle Foundation’s latest amazing work.
” The news of Mr. Richman’s death came shortly after two students who survived last year’s school shooting in Parkland, Fla.
, also died in apparent suicides.
In response to Mr. Richman’s death, the town of Newtown, the Police Department and the school system were planning to bring in mental health professionals to help the community grieve, Lieutenant Bahamonde said.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Richman is survived by two children, Imogen and Owen.

74,1718290,"['Norwegian immigrant', 'Seussentennial', 'Seussentenial']","Audrey Geisel, the widow of the children’s author Theodor Geisel — better known as Dr. Seuss — and the overseer of his estate and guardian of his legacy since his death in 1991, died on Wednesday at her home in San Diego.
She was
97. Random House Children’s Books, her husband’s publisher, announced the death.
Before Mr. Geisel died, he told his wife that she would be in charge of all the creatures he had created, including the Cat in the Hat, Horton the elephant and the Grinch.
Taking care of them became her mission.
She developed and oversaw a global operation of publishing ventures, film projects, games and celebrations that kept Dr. Seuss’s name, and his beloved stories, in front of successive generations of children as they learned to read.
She was deeply involved in the marketing and managing of all his material.
Some people complained that her aggressive commercialism went beyond the wishes of her very private husband.
“You use it or you lose it,” she responded to San Diego Magazine in 2007 when asked about that complaint.
“If we’re not out there — if we don’t keep up the reminders and remembrances — you fall off.
And as long as I’m here, that isn’t going to happen.
” In 1993 she founded Dr. Seuss Enterprises, whose stated mission was to “protect the integrity of the Dr. Seuss books while expanding beyond books into ancillary areas.
” That meant keeping a sharp eye on copyrights and trademarks as Dr. Seuss merchandise and spinoffs were sold around the world.
It also meant overseeing several film adaptations of his work, among them computer-animated adaptations of “Horton Hears a Who!” and “The Lorax,” as well as the 2000 live-action film “Dr.
Seuss’ How The Grinch Stole Christmas,” starring Jim Carrey, which was one of the worst-reviewed movies of the year and yet one of the highest-grossing.
(Ms.
Geisel was the executive producer on many of these film projects, most recently the animated “Grinch,” starring the voice of Benedict Cumberbatch;
it opened last month to mediocre reviews.
) Not everything made money.
The 2000 Broadway show “Seussical” was a flop.
And Ms. Geisel did not hide her annoyance that Universal Pictures cast Mike Myers in the title role of “The Cat in the Hat” (2003), which also sagged at the box office.
She felt he was ill suited for the part.
The reviews were terrible — A. O. Scott of The New York Times called it “a vulgar, uninspired lump of poisoned eye candy” — and it prompted Ms. Geisel to declare that she would never allow another live-action portrayal of Seuss characters.
Over the years she repeatedly told interviewers that she was still recovering from that experience.
As she often put it, “I’m just getting my ‘Cat’ out of the litter box.
” Ms. Geisel presided over a year’s worth of ceremonies in 2004 celebrating the 100th anniversary of her husband’s birth under the title “Seussentenial: A Century of Imagination.
” Random House sells 10 million Dr. Seuss books a year, and new ones crop up periodically.
During a home renovation in 2013, Ms. Geisel found a manuscript for a previously unpublished Dr. Seuss book, “What Pet Should I Get?” Random House published it in 2015 with a first printing of one million copies.
Ms. Geisel, a petite woman of boundless energy, would hold court each morning with aides at a hotel restaurant in San Diego, The Associated Press reported, arriving in a 1984 Cadillac with a license plate that said GRINCH.
In addition to running Dr. Seuss Enterprises, she devoted herself to philanthropy, supporting dozens of charitable organizations.
She gave $20 million and thousands of her husband’s drawings and manuscripts to the University of California, San Diego, where the Geisel Library is named for both of them.
She and her husband also donated millions over the years to what is now the Audrey and Theodor Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College, where Mr. Geisel was an undergraduate.
Audrey Stone was born on Aug. 14, 1921, in Chicago.
Her father, Norman Alfred Stone, who was a song and dance man, left the family early.
Her mother, Ruth (Benson) Stone, a Norwegian immigrant, moved to New York and raised Audrey on her own in and around Queens.
When Audrey was 5, her mother decided to live in a nurse’s dormitory to save money and sent her daughter to live with a friend in New Rochelle, N.Y., for five years.
When she was 21, she enrolled in the nursing program at Indiana University, where she met E. Grey Dimond, a pre-med student whom she would soon marry.
He became the dean of cardiology at the University of Kansas, and they had two daughters before they moved to the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego in 1960.
There the Dimonds became friends with Mr. Geisel and his first wife, Helen.
Mr. Geisel was 17 years older than Ms. Dimond, but they fell in love, and in 1967 Helen Geisel, who suffered from several illnesses, committed suicide with an overdose of barbiturates.
In a note she left to Mr. Geisel, she wrote in part, “My going will leave quite a rumor, but you can say I was overworked and overwrought,” according to “Dr.
Seuss &
Mr. Geisel” (1995), a biography by Judith and Neil Morgan.
Ms. Dimond divorced her husband to marry Mr. Geisel, at which point she sent her daughters, ages 9 and 14, away to school.
“They wouldn’t have been happy with Ted, and Ted wouldn’t have been happy with them,” she told The Times in 2000.
He was afraid of children, she said, especially of their unpredictability.
“He lived his whole life without children, and he was very happy without children,” she added.
“I’ve never been very maternal.
There were too many other things I wanted to do.
My life with him was what I wanted my life to be.
” After Mr. Geisel died, she said, she apologized to her daughters for not being “the best of mothers,” and they became closer.
Her survivors include those daughters, Lark Grey Dimond-Cates and Leagrey Dimond.
“She never looked back, only forward, and she had a great spirit for life,” Leagrey Dimond wrote on Friday in The San Diego Union-Tribune.
“She sailed forth with that distinctive walk: head up, shoulders back, jaunty, as if she had just twirled her baton.

He became the dean of cardiology at the University of Kansas, and they had two daughters before they moved to the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego in 1960.
There the Dimonds became friends with Mr. Geisel and his first wife, Helen.
Mr. Geisel was 17 years older than Ms. Dimond, but they fell in love, and in 1967 Helen Geisel, who suffered from several illnesses, committed suicide with an overdose of barbiturates.
In a note she left to Mr. Geisel, she wrote in part, “My going will leave quite a rumor, but you can say I was overworked and overwrought,” according to “Dr.
Seuss &
Mr. Geisel” (1995), a biography by Judith and Neil Morgan.
Ms. Dimond divorced her husband to marry Mr. Geisel, at which point she sent her daughters, ages 9 and 14, away to school.
“They wouldn’t have been happy with Ted, and Ted wouldn’t have been happy with them,” she told The Times in 2000.
He was afraid of children, she said, especially of their unpredictability.
“He lived his whole life without children, and he was very happy without children,” she added.
“I’ve never been very maternal.
There were too many other things I wanted to do.
My life with him was what I wanted my life to be.
” After Mr. Geisel died, she said, she apologized to her daughters for not being “the best of mothers,” and they became closer.
Her survivors include those daughters, Lark Grey Dimond-Cates and Leagrey Dimond.
“She never looked back, only forward, and she had a great spirit for life,” Leagrey Dimond wrote on Friday in The San Diego Union-Tribune.
“She sailed forth with that distinctive walk: head up, shoulders back, jaunty, as if she had just twirled her baton.

— President Trump said on Friday that there would be a “very good likelihood” that he would seal off the United States border with Mexico next week, even as he moved to punish Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador for migrant caravans by cutting off all foreign aid to the countries.
The moves escalated a sustained berating of countries he blames for being unable to stop the flow of migrants trying to make their way north.
“I will close the border if Mexico doesn’t get with it,” Mr. Trump said to reporters who had gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his winter retreat in Florida.
“If Mexico doesn’t stop it.
” At Mr. Trump’s direction, the State Department on Friday began the process of informing Congress that it intended to end the foreign aid.
A person with knowledge of the decision said that Mr. Trump met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday, after which diplomats were directed to begin the process of cutting off the funds by drafting letters to lawmakers.
Mr. Trump publicly said as much on Friday in comments to reporters.
“No money goes there anymore,” Mr. Trump said.
“We’re giving them tremendous aid.
We stopped payment.
” The State Department issued a statement late on Friday saying: “At the secretary’s instruction, we are carrying out the president’s direction and ending FY 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle.
We will be engaging Congress as part of this process.
” Mr. Trump has threatened to close off the border and cut off aid to the three countries — known as the Northern Triangle — several times before and has not followed through.
But his comments on Friday signaled a new escalation and a diplomatic assault on America’s neighbors in the hemisphere as his administration confirmed that it would review ways to reshuffle Border Patrol agents, shut down traffic lanes and close ports of entry at the southwest border.
He began the day with a morning tweet saying that he would close the border “next week,” and then told reporters that he was prepared to close off trade and commercial ports of entry.
A full or partial sealing of the border would effectively close off the United States from one of its largest trading partners, but it could leave American citizens who cross back and forth with a sluggish or potentially nonexistent system of returning to the United States.
“I’m not playing games,” Mr. Trump said on Friday, as he threatened to close the border with Mexico.

] The president has been emboldened since the release of a report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, found that his campaign had not cooperated with the Russian government.
And a partisan upholding of his national emergency declaration over a wall along the southwestern border has prompted Mr. Trump to ratchet up harsh words against immigration as he seeks to galvanize supporters ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
As he engaged in multiple photo opportunities throughout the day, Mr. Trump’s actions and comments indicated that his mind was not on the scenes at hand but on immigration.
“How are we doing at the border?” he asked a military official on a tour of Lake Okeechobee, the site of a restoration project in the central part of the state.
During a meeting at Mar-a-Lago to announce that Linda McMahon, who has led the Small Business Administration, had resigned, he again turned to immigration.

“They’re the Democrats’ laws, and I got stuck with them.
” Mr. Trump’s decision to end the aid to the Central American countries is likely to anger members of Congress from both parties, who have supported spending money to try to address the root causes of the violence that has caused migrants to flee those countries to come to the United States.
Currently, the United States spends about $620 million a year for gang prevention programs and other initiatives aimed at helping support civil society in the three countries.
Advocates say that cutting the funds will only accelerate the migrant flows into the United States.
But the president has repeatedly expressed anger that the United States sends money to the countries even as caravans of migrants make their way to the border.
In an email from the director of the Office of U.S.
Foreign Assistance Resources on Friday night, senior State Department and United States Agency for International Development officials were instructed to “redirect” all 2018 assistance “away from these countries” and to “cease and desist” all 2017 spending already started.
The email sent State Department officials scrambling to carry out the president’s order.
It was unclear how quickly the funding would cease since the governments had not yet been notified formally of the decision.
It is also unclear whether the department can redirect all of the money to other parts of the world.
Some of the money meant for the 2017 fiscal year has already been allocated to specific contracts, so it might not be able to be withdrawn, according to a person familiar with the effort.
Mr. Trump told reporters that he would consider shutting down ports along the border, a decision that could imperil the transit of goods between the United States and Mexico.
According to government figures, Mexico is the United States’ third-largest goods trading partner, with $557.6 billion worth of products flowing across the border in both directions.
A move by Mr. Trump to shut down or drastically curb trade with Mexico would pose significant risks to the American economy.
It would also represent a stunning reversal in trade relations between the two countries, which last August put their differences aside to renegotiate their portion of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The new deal, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, still needs to be approved by Congress.
The president lamented that Mexico was making a “fortune” off the United States, and said Mexico’s immigration laws were the “strongest immigration laws of anywhere in the world.
” (Mexico is much weaker than the United States at enforcing its border laws.) Mr. Trump also again invoked migrant caravans — including one containing hundreds of people heading to the United States — as a reason Mexico needed to act.
“Mexico is tough,” Mr. Trump said.
“If they don’t stop them, we’re closing the border.
” Americans would feel the effects in other ways.
Border control agencies are already reviewing ways to slow down immigration processing at the border.
A senior homeland security official confirmed on Friday that shutting down ports of entry along the southwest border was “on the table” to handle the surge in migrants seeking asylum.
Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, said in a statement that she had asked volunteers to add more support at the border, and suggested that American citizens may encounter difficulty getting through as a result.
“Make no mistake: Americans may feel effects from this emergency,” Ms. Nielsen said.
“As personnel are reallocated to join the crisis-response effort, there may be commercial delays, higher vehicle wait times at the border and longer pedestrian lines.
” She added that “despite these impacts, we cannot shirk our responsibility to the American people to do everything possible to secure our country while also upholding our humanitarian values.
” Stephen H. Legomsky, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said there were a few options available to Mr. Trump if he wanted to move to stop the flow of people at the border, including slowing down processing at ports of entry.
The administration has already limited the number of migrants who can apply for asylum each day.
“He could pretend that this was necessary in the interest of national security,” Mr. Legomsky said, “and it could be that the courts would be hesitant to second guess a national security claim by a president.
” Mr. Legomsky said putting up trade roadblocks and slowing down the processing of people would have harmful effects, both on American citizens who could find themselves “marooned” in Mexico and on families, including groups of women and children, who are fleeing violence and poverty.
“There’s a huge humanitarian concern,” Mr. Legomsky said.
“So many of the people are these Central American mothers and children fleeing from high levels of violence.

76,1801333,"['political', 'sign up', 'politcs', 'world', 'daily newsletter', 'ideas shaping']","MIAMI — Two nights, 20 candidates, four hours and one unforgettable collision between former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Kamala Harris.
Here is what we learned about the state of the 2020 primary race from the debates on Wednesday and Thursday nights, which drew huge numbers of viewers — 15.3 million watched the first face-off on television alone — whose reactions could reshape the race.
The political questions about Mr. Biden revolve around durability.
His durability as a candidate.
The durability of his support.
And the durability of his association in the minds of voters, especially black voters, with Barack Obama, who remains among the most popular Democrats in the country.
Mr. Biden’s sometimes meandering debate performance on Thursday night did little to quell the growing sense among his rivals that, while he remains atop the polls, the 2020 Democratic presidential race remains wide open seven months before the Iowa caucuses.
Strategists for Mr. Biden’s rivals are already whispering about whether he has lost a step.
He had the ignominious honor of being the only candidate at Thursday’s debate to back away from a fight by cutting off his own remarks.
“Anyway, my time is up,” he said.
“I’m sorry.
” What has worked on the stump for Mr. Biden — injecting his perceived ability to beat President Trump and his broad defense of American democracy — proved ineffective on a stage filled with fellow Democrats.
Mr. Biden name-dropped Mr. Trump three times in his first answer, but what will be remembered was the withering assault on him by Ms. Harris.
Mr. Biden struggled to respond as she drew upon her own race to question his stance on busing and integration.
He made a false claim by arguing that his opposition to busing had been limited to fighting the federal government’s role.
That argument baffled Faiz Shakir, Senator Bernie Sanders’s campaign manager.
“Are we still debating whether the federal government should have a role over desegregating schools?” Mr. Shakir said.
Almost since her splashy January announcement that she was entering the race, Ms. Harris has been treading water.
She has topped out at the mid-to-high single digits in polling.
Early-state activists have grumbled about her lack of attention.
She has seen her fund-raising figures overtaken, first by Mr. Biden and likely in the next quarter by Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
Senator Elizabeth Warren has grabbed the mantle of the race’s pacesetter on policy.
And Ms. Harris has vacillated between competing for the party’s most progressive voters and its more moderate wing.
But she commanded the stage on Thursday in a way no one else has done.
With Democrats looking for someone who can go toe-to-toe with Mr. Trump in general election debates, Ms. Harris embraced what many have long seen as two potential advantages she has in a primary where black voters and women are crucial constituencies: she is the most strongly positioned black woman ever to run for president.
“I would like to speak on the issue of race,” Ms. Harris declared, redirecting what had been a conversation on a recent South Bend police shooting to Mr. Biden’s record.
The ensuing exchange over busing, integration and segregationists showcased Ms. Harris at her best.
Those scripted prosecutorial skills that have gone viral in Senate committee hearings were witnessed live by millions.
And make no mistake, there was a script.
Ms. Harris’s campaign was at the ready with a photo from her childhood and the tagline, “There was a little girl in California who was bussed to school.
That little girl was me.
” There were even shirts on sale by the night’s end with the picture on them.
The timing of her breakout could not have been better: With the second quarter fund-raising deadline on Sunday, she is poised to get an infusion of cash.
Ms. Warren had the Wednesday night debate to herself among the top five candidates in the polls, and the early minutes showed the remarkable degree to which she has been setting the policy agenda in the contest.
That notion has irked the Sanders campaign, which believes Mr. Sanders deserves credit for pulling the party to the left (Exhibit A: Medicare for All), arguing that his insurgent campaign in 2016 set the stage for the policy discussions the party is having in the 2020 race.
In Thursday’s debate, Mr. Sanders was mostly a non-factor.
Advertised as his marquee matchup with Mr. Biden, he instead repeated more than once that the most important thing was which candidate would take on special interests.
But he declined to single out Mr. Biden the way he did with Hillary Clinton in 2016.
While Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders debated on opposite nights, the ideological collision course became ever clearer, even as their bases seem to differ demographically.
(Ms.
Warren’s supporters are seen by both campaigns as skewing older, more female and more educated;
Mr. Sanders as more male, younger and blue-collar.
) The two senators are genuinely fond of one another personally, aides say.
But more direct confrontations seem inevitable after the debates made clearer than ever that they are the leading liberal standard-bearers in the race.
The chief Republican takeaway from the two debates can be boiled down to this: leading Democrats declared they want to take away your private health insurance and provide coverage to undocumented immigrants.
That may be an unfair oversimplification.
But the combined hand-raising exercises over two nights had some top Democratic contenders proudly and visually showing that they supported abolishing private health insurance companies, while every candidate on stage, including Mr. Biden, thrust their arms into the air on Thursday to show their support for providing health care to immigrants who are in the United States without documentation.
There were other moments ripe for Republican operatives to clip, including the extensive conversation about not deporting people whose only crime is being in America illegally — what Mr. Trump would almost certainly frame as an “open borders” position.
“Immigration and health care were gifts to our party, especially immigration,” said Matt Gorman, a Republican strategist who worked for House Republicans in the 2018 midterm elections.
“Trump knows how to tap into that issue as naturally as you ride a bike.
” Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and adviser to Donald Trump Jr., also cited immigration and health care as two of the most potent issues to emerge, calling the debates “a prolonged general election attack ad for Republicans.
” One of the hardest things to do in a presidential campaign is to burst from the lower rungs of a contest into the national conversation.
Mr. Buttigieg has done it in recent months.
And Julián Castro, who had been the mostly forgotten former Obama housing secretary, made his biggest push yet in the first debate as he tore into his fellow Texan, Beto O’Rourke, over immigration.
Across two debates with very few clear winners, he established himself as a forceful presence on the stage and a candidate likely to garner increased attention.
The fact that Mr. Castro had been typecast as mild-mannered has grated on his campaign.
“He’s not the loudest person out there, the flashiest person out there, but he’s not like just a wilting leaf,” said Joaquin Castro, his twin brother and campaign chairman.
So on Wednesday Mr. Castro even swore.
“It should also piss us all off,” he said of the wrenching photo of a father and 23-month-old daughter who had drowned while trying to cross the Rio Grande from Mexico.
Still, night one of the debates will likely be overshadowed by the fireworks of night two.
Will there be any long-term impact?
“I hope so,” Joaquin Castro said.
“You don’t want to stay at one percent forever!” Ten candidates each on two consecutive nights has consequences.
It limits the airtime of top candidates.
The presence of marginal candidates assures that even so-called lightning rounds drag on.
And key confrontations — and thus comparison opportunities for voters — were determined randomly.
Reminder: It was only by a chance drawing that Mr. Biden faced Ms. Harris on stage and not Senator Cory Booker, the other leading black candidate in the race.
It was Mr. Booker, after all, who had first called for the former vice president to apologize over his recent remarks about working civilly with southern segregationist senators decades ago.
What was especially clear from the two debates is that the 2020 field has cleaved into separate tiers.
And, for now, the top tier is occupied by five candidates: Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Harris, Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg, who delivered a solid, if muted, performance.
Where exactly the next tier begins and ends is murkier.
Mr. Booker, who spoke the most on Wednesday night, is hoping to press into the uppermost tier, and he made a perceptible shift in his message at the debate.
Gone were his old calls for a “revival of civic grace” and a “conspiracy of love.
” Instead, he repeated that he lives in, as he put it, “a low-income black and brown community.
” His team announced that Thursday was his campaign’s second-best day for online fund-raising, after its launch date.
The second tier also includes former Representative Beto O’Rourke, whose first debate performance echoed his recent campaign struggles, and Senator Amy Klobuchar, who drew applause for a remark on abortion rights but didn’t generate significant buzz after the debate.
But it is not clear whether Mr. Castro’s strong performance will be enough to keep him in this tier.
Beyond these candidates, everyone else is seeking to join the conversation, led by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who assertively pushed her message aimed at women but was overshadowed by Ms. Harris’s star turn.
Andrew Yang, who spoke for only a few minutes, seems poised to gain little traction.
But Mr. Yang is already approaching the number of donors needed to advance to the third debate — a threshold only the top tier candidates and Mr. O’Rourke have hit.
Marianne Williamson soaked up airtime with her unusual message, which left many scratching their heads.
Jeff Roe, who was the campaign manager for Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, was craving more.
He called on Republicans to donate to Ms. Williamson to keep her on stage.
He even posted the receipt proving that he had already given her a dollar.

Advertised as his marquee matchup with Mr. Biden, he instead repeated more than once that the most important thing was which candidate would take on special interests.
But he declined to single out Mr. Biden the way he did with Hillary Clinton in 2016.
While Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders debated on opposite nights, the ideological collision course became ever clearer, even as their bases seem to differ demographically.
(Ms.
Warren’s supporters are seen by both campaigns as skewing older, more female and more educated;
Mr. Sanders as more male, younger and blue-collar.
) The two senators are genuinely fond of one another personally, aides say.
But more direct confrontations seem inevitable after the debates made clearer than ever that they are the leading liberal standard-bearers in the race.
The chief Republican takeaway from the two debates can be boiled down to this: leading Democrats declared they want to take away your private health insurance and provide coverage to undocumented immigrants.
That may be an unfair oversimplification.
But the combined hand-raising exercises over two nights had some top Democratic contenders proudly and visually showing that they supported abolishing private health insurance companies, while every candidate on stage, including Mr. Biden, thrust their arms into the air on Thursday to show their support for providing health care to immigrants who are in the United States without documentation.
There were other moments ripe for Republican operatives to clip, including the extensive conversation about not deporting people whose only crime is being in America illegally — what Mr. Trump would almost certainly frame as an “open borders” position.
“Immigration and health care were gifts to our party, especially immigration,” said Matt Gorman, a Republican strategist who worked for House Republicans in the 2018 midterm elections.
“Trump knows how to tap into that issue as naturally as you ride a bike.
” Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and adviser to Donald Trump Jr., also cited immigration and health care as two of the most potent issues to emerge, calling the debates “a prolonged general election attack ad for Republicans.
” One of the hardest things to do in a presidential campaign is to burst from the lower rungs of a contest into the national conversation.
Mr. Buttigieg has done it in recent months.
And Julián Castro, who had been the mostly forgotten former Obama housing secretary, made his biggest push yet in the first debate as he tore into his fellow Texan, Beto O’Rourke, over immigration.
Across two debates with very few clear winners, he established himself as a forceful presence on the stage and a candidate likely to garner increased attention.
The fact that Mr. Castro had been typecast as mild-mannered has grated on his campaign.
“He’s not the loudest person out there, the flashiest person out there, but he’s not like just a wilting leaf,” said Joaquin Castro, his twin brother and campaign chairman.
So on Wednesday Mr. Castro even swore.
“It should also piss us all off,” he said of the wrenching photo of a father and 23-month-old daughter who had drowned while trying to cross the Rio Grande from Mexico.
Still, night one of the debates will likely be overshadowed by the fireworks of night two.
Will there be any long-term impact?
“I hope so,” Joaquin Castro said.
“You don’t want to stay at one percent forever!” Ten candidates each on two consecutive nights has consequences.
It limits the airtime of top candidates.
The presence of marginal candidates assures that even so-called lightning rounds drag on.
And key confrontations — and thus comparison opportunities for voters — were determined randomly.
Reminder: It was only by a chance drawing that Mr. Biden faced Ms. Harris on stage and not Senator Cory Booker, the other leading black candidate in the race.
It was Mr. Booker, after all, who had first called for the former vice president to apologize over his recent remarks about working civilly with southern segregationist senators decades ago.
What was especially clear from the two debates is that the 2020 field has cleaved into separate tiers.
And, for now, the top tier is occupied by five candidates: Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Harris, Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg, who delivered a solid, if muted, performance.
Where exactly the next tier begins and ends is murkier.
Mr. Booker, who spoke the most on Wednesday night, is hoping to press into the uppermost tier, and he made a perceptible shift in his message at the debate.
Gone were his old calls for a “revival of civic grace” and a “conspiracy of love.
” Instead, he repeated that he lives in, as he put it, “a low-income black and brown community.
” His team announced that Thursday was his campaign’s second-best day for online fund-raising, after its launch date.
The second tier also includes former Representative Beto O’Rourke, whose first debate performance echoed his recent campaign struggles, and Senator Amy Klobuchar, who drew applause for a remark on abortion rights but didn’t generate significant buzz after the debate.
But it is not clear whether Mr. Castro’s strong performance will be enough to keep him in this tier.
Beyond these candidates, everyone else is seeking to join the conversation, led by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who assertively pushed her message aimed at women but was overshadowed by Ms. Harris’s star turn.
Andrew Yang, who spoke for only a few minutes, seems poised to gain little traction.
But Mr. Yang is already approaching the number of donors needed to advance to the third debate — a threshold only the top tier candidates and Mr. O’Rourke have hit.
Marianne Williamson soaked up airtime with her unusual message, which left many scratching their heads.
Jeff Roe, who was the campaign manager for Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, was craving more.
He called on Republicans to donate to Ms. Williamson to keep her on stage.
He even posted the receipt proving that he had already given her a dollar.

The horde of photographers outside the courthouse pointed to the interest the charges have garnered, and how the parents have become symbols of what many believe is a rigged system, not just in college admissions but in American society at large.
Even before the 33 parents charged in the scandal have their cases heard in court, they are facing repercussions, from the practical limitations of being on bail to the public shame of being held up as examples of greed and entitlement.
They have been placed on leave or lost their jobs, had book contracts canceled and television shows scrapped.
They must seek permission to leave the country, and for now, it seems, international vacations are out.
“There does seem to be a certain assumption that these people are guilty just based upon the accusation — and that’s not true, and that’s not fair,” said David Schumacher, a lawyer for two of the parents, Gregory and Amy Colburn.
The Colburns pleaded not guilty on Wednesday.
[Read the full list of who has been charged here.] Ms. Loughlin and her husband, the designer Mossimo Giannulli, are accused of conspiring with William Singer — the college consultant at the center of the alleged scheme — to pay $500,000 in bribes to facilitate their daughters’ admission to the University of Southern California.
The Hallmark Channel, where Ms. Loughlin has major roles on a show and a television movie series, has said that it will stop development of shows featuring her.
Prosecutors say Ms. Huffman paid Mr. Singer $15,000 to cheat on her daughter’s SAT.
It is not clear yet how the charges have affected Ms. Huffman’s career.
Netflix, which is behind two of her current projects — one that is completed, and another that is in postproduction — has not commented on the case.
But, like Ms. Loughlin, Ms. Huffman has been derided on social media, and she has deleted her parenting blog, “What the Flicka.
” Ms. Huffman’s and Ms. Loughlin’s interviews by Magistrate Judge M. Page Kelley on Wednesday each lasted less than five minutes.
The parents have all been charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, and are accused of conspiring with Mr. Singer to either cheat on college entrance exams or pay bribes to game the admissions process.

Prosecutors have accused Gregory Colburn, a radiation oncologist in Palo Alto, Calif.
, and his wife, Amy, of conspiring with Mr. Singer to cheat on their son’s SAT exam.
One of their lawyers, Patric Hooper, said that Dr. Colburn’s career had already been severely damaged because of a chain of consequences that result when a doctor is charged with a crime.
Already, he said, a state licensing board had begun an investigation of Dr. Colburn.
Dr. Colburn had to notify Medicare and Medicaid that he was under investigation — and they could suspend him if they chose to, Mr. Hooper said, which would make it very difficult to practice.
He has also had to notify the hospitals where he is on the medical staff.
“His reputation is destroyed before he’s even given an opportunity to defend himself,” Mr. Hooper said.

But she said she would no longer impose that condition.

78,1764919,"['virginia beach', 'beach police', 'virginian-pilot', 'among hundreds', 'hundreds of people', 'Police Department']","In the nearly 30 years that Ernest J. Broadnax has lived in New York City, he has always been known for getting into trouble, with 14 arrests on charges like assault and burglary.
He served three stints in state prison.
But now, in an advanced age, he’s become known to neighbors as a cordial, but distant man, who has struggled with alcohol and drug addiction.
But none of the crimes in New York that he was charged with were as severe as the gruesome killings he is now accused of having committed.
This week, the police in Queens arrested Mr. Broadnax for the 1973 murders of two women who had been vacationing in Virginia, the police there said.
A cold-case squad in Virginia Beach identified Mr. Broadnax, who is in his 80s, as a suspect by using technology that did not even exist when the women, Lynn Seethaler and Janice Pietropola, both 19, were killed inside a  motel cottage near the oceanfront.
DNA evidence found at the crime scene was used last fall to match Mr. Broadnax’s profile in a national database, a Virginia Beach law enforcement official said.
The official did not say what type of DNA was collected from the scene, and requested anonymity to discuss the pending case because doing so is illegal under Virginia law.
Mr. Broadnax, a native of Virginia, was arrested on Monday on a fugitive warrant issued by the Virginia Beach police.
Officials there said he is charged with two counts of murder and one count of rape.
He is being held on a New York City jail barge awaiting extradition, according to the police and jail records.
“Our objective now is to be able to bring justice for the victims, and for their families to be able to have a sense of peace and closure,” said Officer Linda Kuehn, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Beach police.
Ms. Seethaler and Ms. Pietropola were from Pittsburgh, Pa.
, and were on vacation when their bodies were found in an oceanside motel on June 30, 1973, according to the local police’s online summary of the case.
William Haden, the retired detective who handled the case, said in an interview on Tuesday that the killer strangled Ms. Seethaler, slashed her throat and shot her twice in the head;
Ms. Pietropola was strangled, raped and shot three times, he said.
A motel clerk had called the police after the women failed to show up to check out at the end of their weeklong stay, Mr. Haden said.
Investigators questioned two men who had dated the women, but did not charge them with a crime.
Then the case went cold.
Mr. Haden left the Virginia Beach Police Department in 1998, but the case stuck with him.
“I am just relieved,” he said.
“It was an albatross around my neck all those years, and that albatross has now been removed.
” The arrest stunned Adedayo Peterson, whose mother was briefly married to Mr. Broadnax in the 1970s.
She said Mr. Broadnax had served in the Army and had been incarcerated in Virginia before he met her mother.
“I didn’t expect nothing like that,” Ms. Peterson said.
“But I wouldn’t put it past him.
” The marriage, his second, was short-lived and soured after Mr. Broadnax became violent.
He once whipped her mother with a belt and on another occasion pulled a gun on her brother, Ms. Peterson said.
A public defense lawyer assigned to Mr. Broadnax’s case could not be reached for comment.
A local television station, WTKR, reported in 2011 that the killings of Ms. Seethaler and Ms. Pietropola were two of at least 12 women with similar physical traits who were murdered or went missing in Virginia Beach between 1973 and 1985.
Though the police considered the possibility of a serial killer, investigators were unable to determine if the killings were connected, Mr. Haden said.
Some of the women were killed in their homes and two were found floating in the ocean.
Several other women vanished from the oceanfront and have never been found.
“Of course you look at that,” Mr. Haden said of trying to connect the killings.
“You wouldn’t be worth the powder on your shoes if you didn’t.
” Mr. Broadnax has lived in New York since at least 1990, where he has been incarcerated three times for crimes including assault, according to corrections records.
State law required him to submit DNA because he was convicted of a felony.
He was released from prison on parole in 2013, after serving most of an eight-year sentence for assault, according to state prison records.
In that incident, the police said he was selling metal scraps in Manhattan in 2006 when he got into a fight with a customer and broke the man’s arm.
He settled into a first-floor apartment in Hollis, Queens, where neighbors said he was quiet but cordial, waving hello to neighbors, and carrying on small talk.
“He was one of the older people in the building,” said one neighbor, who also refused to give their name.
“Sometimes he forgot things, like he had dementia.
We all looked out for him, you know?” A few months ago, Patrick Penafiel, 63, said, that he saw three detectives in the hallway, questioning Mr. Broadnax before searching his apartment.
Mr. Penafiel only recalled one occasion when Mr. Broadnax socialized, when he was invited to a tenants’ meeting.
“He told us he was a recovering alcoholic, and drug addict,” he said.
“He showed us his diploma from a rehabilitation center.
We all clapped for him.

79,1803047,"['census form', 'citizenship question', 'reiterated his unwillingness', 'citizenship question', 'give up in a twitter', 'twitter message']","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration, in a dramatic about-face, abandoned its quest on Tuesday to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, a week after being blocked by the Supreme Court.
Faced with mounting deadlines and a protracted legal fight, officials ordered the Census Bureau to start printing forms for next year’s head count without the question.
The decision was a victory for critics who said the question was part of an administration effort to skew the census results in favor of Republicans.
It was also a remarkable retreat for an administration that typically digs into such fights.
Just last week after the Supreme Court’s decision, President Trump said he was asking his lawyers to delay the census, “no matter how long,” in order to fight for the question in court.
Word of the action came in a one-sentence email from the Justice Department to lawyers for plaintiffs in a New York lawsuit that sought to block the question’s inclusion in the head count.
The email offered no explanation, but the administration was confronting weeks or months of additional legal challenges to the question.
Meanwhile, the Census Bureau had said it needed to begin printing questionnaires by July 1 to meet the April 2020 deadline for conducting the census.
The administration’s decision appeared to end a yearlong battle over the country’s all-important decennial head count.
Census results are used to divvy up seats in the House of Representatives and to draw political maps at all levels of government.
They are also used to allot federal funding for key social services.
The addition of a citizenship question to the census could have had profound implications for American politics.
Officials at the Census Bureau itself have said that including the question would lead to an undercount of noncitizens and minority residents.
As a result, areas with more immigrants, which tend to vote Democratic, could have lost both representation and federal funding.
The Supreme Court last week rejected the administration’s stated reason for adding a question on citizenship to the census, and while the decision was not a conclusive ruling, the justices placed a daunting hurdle before the government.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement Tuesday evening that he respected the Supreme Court, but strongly disagreed with its ruling.
“The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question,” he said.
“My focus, and that of the Bureau and the entire Department is to conduct a complete and accurate census.
” Dale Ho, director of the Voting Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, which was among the plaintiffs trying to block the question, praised the outcome, saying the Supreme Court left the administration with “no choice but to proceed with printing the 2020 census forms without a citizenship question.
” As drafted by the administration, the census would have asked: “Is this person a citizen of the United States?” Options were to include: “Yes, born in the United States”;
“Yes, born in Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S.
Virgin Islands, or Northern Marianas”;
“Yes, born abroad of U.S. citizen parent or parents”;
“Yes, U.S. citizen by naturalization”;
or “No, not a U.S. citizen.
” For the last year, there has been a bitter legal battle over whether the Commerce Department broke the law when it decided in March 2018 to tack a citizenship question onto the census, long after other aspects of the questionnaire had been finalized.
The department, which oversees the Census Bureau, had argued that the Justice Department needed a more accurate count of citizens to enforce the 1965 Voting Rights Act, but three lower courts ruled that that was an obvious pretext for some other unstated goal.
The department’s explanation was further undermined last month after plaintiffs uncovered computer files from a deceased Republican political strategist, Thomas B. Hofeller, who had first urged the incoming Trump administration in 2016 to consider adding the question to the next census.
The files included a study in which Mr. Hofeller concluded that a citizenship question was central to a strategy to increase Republican political power by excluding noncitizens and persons under voting age from the census figures used for drawing new political boundaries in 2021.
The disclosure led to the reopening of one of the lawsuits opposing the question, and plaintiffs were scheduled to begin new efforts this month to prove that the question was an effort to discriminate against Hispanics for political gain.
On Tuesday, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which represents plaintiffs in that suit, indicated that it was unwilling to end the lawsuit without further assurances from the administration that the issue of the citizenship question had in fact been fully resolved.
Thomas A. Saenz, the organization’s president and general counsel, said his group wanted to make sure there wasn’t any misinformation spread about there still being a citizenship question.
“No matter what happens, there’s still a lingering hardship from how long the administration had this hanging out there, and the publicity it got,” he said.
Opposition to the citizenship question was rooted among local governments and advocacy groups representing ethnic minorities, all of whom feared that the question’s mere presence on the census would deter noncitizens and even legal immigrants from filling out the form for fear of government retaliation.
The groups’ victory on Tuesday may have eased that threat, but hardly eliminated it.
The public controversy over the issue has already stirred fears of retribution among many immigrants, who say they will avoid filling out the census form even if the question is not asked.
“Now is the time to shift gears and begin robust education and outreach campaigns to ensure each person in this country is counted,” said Letitia James, the attorney general of New York, which was also among the plaintiffs suing to block the question.
“Everyone counts, therefore everyone must be counted.
”
","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration, in a dramatic about-face, abandoned its quest on Tuesday to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, a week after being blocked by the Supreme Court.
Faced with mounting deadlines and a protracted legal fight, officials ordered the Census Bureau to start printing forms for next year’s head count without the question.
The decision was a victory for critics who said the question was part of an administration effort to skew the census results in favor of Republicans.
It was also a remarkable retreat for an administration that typically digs into such fights.
Just last week after the Supreme Court’s decision, President Trump said he was asking his lawyers to delay the census, “no matter how long,” in order to fight for the question in court.
He reiterated his unwillingness to give up in a Twitter message posted late Tuesday, saying he had asked administration officials “to do whatever is necessary” to get a citizenship question on the census form.
Word of the administration’s decision to stop fighting came in a one-sentence email from the Justice Department to lawyers for plaintiffs in a New York lawsuit that sought to block the question’s inclusion in the head count.
The email offered no explanation, but the administration was confronting weeks or months of additional legal challenges to the question.
Meanwhile, the Census Bureau had said it needed to begin printing questionnaires by July 1 to meet the April 2020 deadline for conducting the census.
The administration’s decision appeared to end a yearlong battle over the country’s all-important decennial head count.
Census results are used to divvy up seats in the House of Representatives and to draw political maps at all levels of government.
They are also used to allot federal funding for key social services.
The addition of a citizenship question to the census could have had profound implications for American politics.
Officials at the Census Bureau itself have said that including the question would lead to an undercount of noncitizens and minority residents.
As a result, areas with more immigrants, which tend to vote Democratic, could have lost both representation and federal funding.

Eastern time.
We will  live-stream his statement and the Democratic rebuttal on this page and at nytimes.com.
Our team of reporters will also  provide live coverage and fact checks of the remarks.
When is it a “crisis”?
Saying a situation is a crisis does not make it so, but Mr. Trump and other senior administration officials have been using the word repeatedly in recent days to describe the state of affairs along the border.
They point to a direct connection between the flow of drugs from Mexico and the opioid epidemic in the United States.
They say that migrants, particularly women and children, are victims of crime as they travel to the United States.
And Mr. Trump has also strongly suggested that terrorists may be slipping across the border.
These threats are greatly exaggerated, if not fabricated.
Migrant border crossings have been declining for nearly two decades.
The majority of heroin enters the United States through legal ports of entry, not through open areas of the border.
Immigrants are less likely to commit crimes in the United States than native-born Americans.
The State Department said in a recent report that there is “no credible evidence” that terrorist groups had sent operatives to enter the United States through Mexico.
Despite all of this, Mr. Trump could repeat some of these statistics, which other administration officials have cited misleadingly.
— Michael Tackett [Read more about what to watch for in the speech.] Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, will speak from the Capitol after Mr. Trump finishes his remarks from the Oval Office.
The dueling speeches from opposite sides of Pennsylvania Avenue will unfold at the close of Day 18 of a government shutdown over Mr. Trump’s demand for $5.7 billion for a border wall that Democrats have steadfastly opposed.
The Democratic leaders’ decision to select themselves as the message-bearers to counter the president underscores how a partisan power struggle in a new era of divided government is undergirding the discussions over resolving the shutdown, even as the paychecks of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and benefits for millions of Americans hang in the balance.
Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, also plans to make a public response to Mr. Trump, which his office said would be streamed live on social media platforms after Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer conclude their remarks.
The move was reminiscent of how a fractious Republican Party responded to State of the Union addresses when Barack Obama was president: Republican leaders designated a formal response and Tea Party-aligned conservatives chose their own messengers to deliver a different rebuttal.
— Julie Hirschfeld Davis [Read more about the Democratic response.] Mr. Trump could also try to circumvent Congress by declaring a national emergency to order that the wall be built, but administration officials who had seen a draft copy of his speech said the president was not preparing to do so.
The rationale for the emergency power is to give the president the capacity to act quickly to deal with matters like an urgent security threat.
For example, President George W. Bush invoked emergency powers after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
— Michael Tackett A dozen Senate Democrats are taking the floor this evening for a talkathon-style protest calling on Mr. Trump and Senate Republicans to end the government shutdown.
Led by  Senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, it is yet another effort to raise the pressure on Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, to allow a vote on legislation that would reopen the government.
Earlier Tuesday,  Senate Democrats voted against advancing a package of bipartisan Middle East policy bills slated for consideration this week to further press Republicans.
Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor on Tuesday that he would “not waste time on show votes.
” But he is also being pushed by vulnerable members of his own party up for re-election in 2020 to intervene and end the shutdown.
— Catie Edmondson What is normally an easy decision for network executives — granting airtime to a sitting president to address the nation — led to hours of hand-wringing by journalists and producers wary of giving a platform to a president whose public remarks, particularly on immigration, have been marked by untruths and misleading claims.
Liberals wondered why news outlets would defer to a president who, hours earlier, had used Twitter to label journalists “the Enemy of the People,” “the real Opposition Party” and “crazed lunatics.
” Eventually, ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox agreed to a request by Mr. Trump for the airtime, forgoing their 9 p.m. entertainment shows — and millions of dollars in associated ad revenue — for his Oval Office appearance, in which he plans to address the government shutdown.
The networks said on Tuesday that they would also broadcast the Democratic response.
— Michael S. Grynbaum [Read more about the media decision.]
","Here’s what the president said, and how it stacks up against the facts.
Democrats have offered $1.3 billion in funding for border security measures like enhanced surveillance and fortified fencing.
They do not support Mr. Trump’s border wall.
At a meeting with Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer in December, Mr. Trump took responsibility for the partial government shutdown.
“I will take the mantle.
I will be the one to shut it down.
I’m not going to blame you for it,” he said.
— Linda Qiu In November, the agency, which is actually named Customs and Border Protection (and which oversees the Border Patrol), apprehended 51,856 people trying to cross the border illegally.
That’s about 1,700 per day.
The agency also deemed another 10,600 “inadmissible,” which refers to people who seek lawful entry into the United States but are barred from doing so.
Together, that would be over 2,000, but “inadmissible” is not the same thing as illegal entry.
— Linda Qiu Twenty-six Senate Democrats — including Mr. Schumer — voted for a 2006 law that authorized about 700 miles of fencing along the southwest border.
During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump characterized the 2006 legislation as inadequate, dismissing it as “such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall.
” As part of his campaign, Mr. Trump promised to build a 1,000-mile concrete border wall.
He sometimes calls the wall a fence, though he has also rejected suggestions that it is a fence.
— Linda Qiu Some economists argue that immigrants drive down available jobs and wages for Americans only if they are competing for the same jobs as the domestic work force.
In many cases, immigrants — legal or illegal — are seeking jobs that American citizens do not want to do.
Kevin Hassett, the White House’s top economist, argued before joining the Trump administration that immigration spurs economic growth and that the United States should double its intake of immigrants.
— Alan Rappeport Most heroin smuggled into the United States does come through the southwest border, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration’s latest National Drug Threat Assessment report.
Fentanyl is a narcotic that is used to treat severe pain and is a key contributor the opioid crisis.
It is also sometimes mixed with heroin.
But most fentanyl enters the United States from packages mailed directly from China through traditional ports of entry, according to the report, and through Canada from China.
A lower-potency, lower-cost grade of fentanyl is also smuggled across the southwest border from Mexico.
The fentanyl directly from China is far more lucrative for sellers because of its higher purity.
The fentanyl sent through conventional mail packages has proved difficult for law enforcement to detect.
Fentanyl coming from Mexico is often hidden in automobile compartments, much like conventional drug smuggling.
The president’s opioids commission reported last November that “we are losing this fight predominately through China.
” — Michael Tackett In the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested over 210,876 people with previous criminal convictions, and another 55,233 people with pending criminal charges.
But it should be noted that these criminal convictions covered a range of offenses, including many that were nonviolent.
The most common charges were for traffic violations, possessing or selling drugs and immigration offenses like illegal entry.
— Linda Qiu First, the revised North American Free Trade Agreement, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, has yet to pass in Congress.
Any economic benefits from the agreement, if it passes, will most likely come in the form of lower tariffs for American companies or higher wages for American workers.
This is different from Mr. Trump’s campaign promise that Mexico would finance the wall.
— Alan Rappeport The president has claimed that the annual cost of illegal drugs in the United States is $500 billion.
But a 2015 report by the surgeon general estimated that the annual economic impact of illicit drug use is $193 billion.
Stopping the flow of drugs across the southwest border would not entirely stem the flow of drugs across the United States.
Moreover, it is not clear how reducing the cost of drug addiction would finance the wall.
— Alan Rappeport Fact check: the Democratic response Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader: An estimated 800,000 federal workers are furloughed or working without pay because of the shutdown.
While millions of Americans are not being directly harmed, there is a multiplier effect when considering family members of those whose jobs are affected.
This also spills into the broader economy, harming business owners whose customers must cut back, tourism and travel.
— Alan Rappeport Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told Fox News’s Sean Hannity that he had never seen Mr. Trump behave in such a presidential manner.
And he issued a dire warning to Mr. Trump’s base.
“If we undercut the president, that’s the end of his presidency and the end of our party,” Mr. Graham said.
“As the president clearly laid out tonight, we have a growing humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border,” Representative Kay Granger of Texas, the ranking member on the House Appropriations Committee, said in a statement.
“I stand ready and willing to work with the White House and my friends on both sides of the aisle in the House and Senate to find a legislative solution to border security and reopen the government.
” Even before the speech began, Democrats were preparing their rebuttals.
“President Trump is going to use the public airwaves to spread fear and misinformation tonight,” tweeted Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, the head of the Democrats’ messaging arm.
“I’m going to correct the record.
” In a more lighthearted jab, Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, joked that he unsuccessfully tried to get Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, to “livestream a Trump’s Not Telling The Truth drinking game tonight.
” “Me and him, shot of beer every time Trump says something made up,” Mr. Murphy wrote on Twitter.
“He didn’t bite.
” (Mr.
Schatz, live-tweeting the speech, noted instead: “This is dark.
”) And during the speech, Democrats flooded the internet with their own commentary, frequently reflecting Mr. Trump’s rhetoric back at his administration.
“Donald Trump’s presidency is a national emergency!” wrote Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota.
But it was perhaps Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the No. 5 House Democrat, who most succinctly summed up his party’s response: “We are not paying a $5 billion ransom note for your medieval border wall,” he tweeted, with a castle emoji.
“And nothing you just said will change that cold, hard reality.
” — Emily Cochrane and Catie Edmondson Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, spoke from the Capitol after Mr. Trump finished his remarks from the Oval Office.

— It was three days before the last day of school, and the students inside Ms. Harper’s English classroom were whiling away the last period of the day watching “The Princess Bride” when one of their classmates walked in late and pulled out a gun.
“The only thing he said out loud to the students was ‘Don’t you move,’” said Nui Giasolli, an 18-year-old senior who said she was in the class at the time.
In that moment, she recalled, Kendrick Castillo, a gentle teenager, fascinated by cars and engineering, lunged to stop the gunman and was shot dead.
Eight other students were wounded in the shooting at STEM School Highlands Ranch on Tuesday afternoon, which the authorities said was carried out by two fellow students.
On Wednesday, parents and students across this stunned suburb south of Denver described Mr. Castillo’s actions as the latest act of self-sacrifice by students who now find themselves on the front lines of fighting off gunmen in America’s schools.
Ms. Giasolli said Mr. Castillo’s split-second decision to lunge for the gunman gave the other students a precious few seconds of cover to dive under their desks or rush the gunman.
Ms. Giasolli said a cluster of boys then tackled the gunman, allowing her and others to flee the classroom.
“I don’t have enough words,” Ms. Giasolli said in her living room on Wednesday.
“They didn’t have to risk their lives to save the 15 of us who were left.
” Ms. Giasolli said the seniors stayed close to one another on Tuesday afternoon as SWAT teams cleared their school and then took them to a recreation center where thousands of anxious parents waited to reunite with them.
They hugged one another and broke down sobbing in groups as they learned that Mr. Castillo, also a senior, had died.
She said the tight-knit class was now bonded by grief and shock.
“We’re all shaken,” Ms. Giasolli said.
“It happened right before our eyes.
It happened right in our classroom.
We’re all hurting.
We all did know these kids.
We did know the shooter.
We did know the people who got hurt.
We’re all hurting in our own ways.
” The two students who carried out the attack were identified as an adult male and a juvenile female, the authorities said on Wednesday, as they continued to investigate an assault that Sheriff Tony Spurlock of Douglas County said had reached “deep inside the school.
” Earlier, he said, officers had mistakenly identified the juvenile as a young man.
The suspects carried two handguns, and at least one of them was restrained by a school security officer by the time law enforcement arrived, the sheriff said.
Sheriff Spurlock said the school had two major crime scenes, including a classroom where most of the shooting took place.
“We are going to hear about very heroic things that have taken place,” Sheriff Spurlock said.
While details of the shooting remained sparse, students relayed some of the chaos that erupted in their classroom while they began to eulogize Mr. Castillo.
“He cared about his faith and his family and friends more than himself or anything,” said Sara Stacks, 17, who said Mr. Castillo had been her childhood best friend.
“He was always the first to help when anyone needed it, if it was a friend to talk to, someone to hold the door, or carry something, he would always help no matter what.
” Classmates said that Mr. Castillo had dreams of becoming an engineer like his father, and was interested in how to fix things and frequently tinkered with his Jeep.
Aiden Beatty, 18, a former student at STEM School, described Mr. Castillo as friendly and well-liked.
“He was one of the nicest people at the school,” Mr. Beatty said.
“He was always smiling.
I would always see him around the engineering area with those teachers, working on stuff, building.
” Sheriff Spurlock said deputies had to force their way into the school because it was locked down.
Law enforcement happened to choose a door that was near the shooting and quickly apprehended one of the suspects, who was identified as Devon Erickson,
18. Mr.
Erickson will have his first court hearing on Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. local time, said District Attorney George Brauchler.
He added that he would consider trying the juvenile suspect as an adult.
Mr. Brauchler, a Republican, is well-known in the state for his support of the death penalty, and led the prosecution of the man convicted of killing 12 people in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo.
, in 2012.
A YouTube created in 2015 by a user named Devon Erickson includes dozens of videos of a young man singing covers of contemporary pop songs by artists like Fall Out Boy and Panic!
at the Disco.
In the final video, posted eight months ago, he sings a song called “Nico and the Niners” by Twenty-One Pilots.
He wears and brown jacket and keeps his head bowed low as he sings: “I’m careless when I wear my rebel clothes.
” The YouTube account was taken down sometimes after 10:30 p.m. local time on Tuesday.
On Tuesday evening, police tape was strung up outside the prim brick suburban home where neighbors said Mr. Erickson’s family has lived since the late 1990s.
A next-door neighbor who declined to be named described him as a quiet young man who sometimes deflected eye contact and played several musical instruments.
Sheriff Spurlock said neither suspect had been on law enforcement’s radar before the shooting and that the motive was unknown.
He declined to say how the suspects had obtained the guns, though in Colorado it is illegal for anyone under 21 to own a handgun.
The shooting at the Highlands Ranch charter school is the latest at an educational institution, a phenomenon that has rattled communities nationwide as young people continue to face mortal danger in places long considered safe havens.
One week earlier, a man with a pistol shot six people on the last day of spring classes at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, killing two.
STEM School Highlands Ranch, which has about 1,800 students in kindergarten through 12th grade, will be closed for the rest of the week.
Douglas County is an affluent area south of Denver with about 350,000 people.
It sits next to Jefferson County, home to Columbine High School, and students there are already primed to watch for gunmen.
Students who were not injured on Tuesday afternoon were taken to Northridge Recreation Center in Highlands Ranch, where hundreds of anxious parents gathered to look for their children.
“I heard a gunshot,” said Makai Dixon, 8, a second grader who had been training for this moment, with active shooter drills and lockdowns, since he was in kindergarten.
“I’d never heard it before.
” Makai’s parents said they joined thousands of others in rushing to the school as news blazed through the suburban community.
“We’re more messed up than they are,” Makai’s mother, Rocio, said as they walked to their car.

I would always see him around the engineering area with those teachers, working on stuff, building.
” Sheriff Spurlock said deputies had to force their way into the school because it was locked down.
Law enforcement happened to choose a door that was near the shooting scene and quickly apprehended one of the suspects, who was identified as Devon Erickson,
18. Court documents released on Wednesday identified the second suspect as Maya Elizabeth McKinney.
Mr. Erickson entered his first court hearing on Wednesday wearing a red jumpsuit draped over his thin frame.
His hair, dyed pink and blue, hung over his face.
He sat between his lawyers with his head hanging, and he was shackled at both the wrists and the ankles.
At times his body shook ever so slightly.
The father of Mr. Castillo sat in the front of the court gallery wearing a checkered shirt, with a tense expression on his face.
During the hearing, he turned his head toward Mr. Erickson and glared.
Before the hearing, District Attorney George Brauchler said that he would consider trying the juvenile suspect as an adult.
Mr. Brauchler, a Republican, is well-known in the state for his support of the death penalty, and led the prosecution of the man convicted of killing 12 people in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo.
, in 2012.
A YouTube account created in 2015 by a user named Devon Erickson includes dozens of videos of a young man singing covers of contemporary pop songs by artists like Fall Out Boy and Panic!
at the Disco.
In the final video, posted eight months ago, he sings a song called “Nico and the Niners” by Twenty-One Pilots.
He wears a brown jacket and keeps his head bowed low as he sings: “I’m careless when I wear my rebel clothes.
” The YouTube account was taken down sometime after 10:30 p.m. local time on Tuesday.
On Tuesday evening, police tape was strung up outside the prim brick suburban home where neighbors said Mr. Erickson’s family has lived since the late 1990s.
A next-door neighbor who declined to be named described him as a quiet young man who sometimes deflected eye contact and played several musical instruments.
Sheriff Spurlock said neither suspect had been on law enforcement’s radar before the shooting and that the motive was unknown.
He declined to say how the suspects had obtained the guns, though in Colorado it is illegal for anyone under 21 to own a handgun.
The shooting at the Highlands Ranch charter school is the latest at an educational institution, a phenomenon that has rattled communities nationwide as young people continue to face mortal danger in places long considered safe havens.
One week earlier, a man with a pistol shot six people on the last day of spring classes at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, killing two.
STEM School Highlands Ranch, which has about 1,800 students in kindergarten through 12th grade, will be closed for the rest of the week.
Douglas County is an affluent area south of Denver with about 350,000 people.
It sits next to Jefferson County, home to Columbine High School, and students there are already primed to watch for gunmen.
Mr. Castillo’s attempt to subdue the shooting suspect seemed to parallel the actions of Riley Howell, who tried to take down the gunman at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte last week.
Both young men died and, according to the authorities, probably saved lives.
For many people, the notion of having young people tackle gunmen in the middle of a rampage is a chilling thought.
But Greg Crane, the founder of an active-shooter training program that encourages people to “counter” shooters, said in situations where people cannot escape, disrupting the gunman might be the best approach to end a deadly tragedy.
“Frankly, this is the way these events get stopped the quickest,” said Mr. Crane, who created the “Alice” training method, which stands for Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate.
“Waiting on law enforcement is not enough.
” Mr. Crane’s method has been criticized precisely because its urges civilians to take such an aggressive approach against gunmen.
Other training approaches emphasize running or hiding and letting trained law enforcement confront the attacker.
“But if they don’t do anything and they maintain a static, passive position, waiting for the police to get there — as in Columbine, as in Virginia Tech, as in Sandy Hook — I think you see the casualty statistics are much higher,” Mr. Crane said.

— Abortion access in America is narrowing.
There are fewer clinics, longer drives and more restrictions earlier in pregnancy.
But something else is different: The women themselves.
Women getting abortions today are far more likely to be poor than those who had the procedure done 20 years ago.
Half of all women who got an abortion in 2014 lived in poverty, double the share from 1994, when only about a quarter of the women who had abortions were low-income, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights and conducts a national survey of abortion patients every six years.
The abortion rate has declined by nearly 40 percent since the mid-1990s.
But the United States still has a higher rate of unplanned pregnancy than many other developed countries, and a growing share of women who respond by having an abortion are impoverished.
“The patient population in abortion clinics is increasingly made up of poor women,” said Diana Greene Foster, a demographer at the Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health at the University of California, San Francisco.
The result is that as more states pass stringent laws limiting abortion access, it is increasingly poor women who have to grapple with their effects.
These are also the women who have the least means to travel to states with freer access.
“Whenever states enact restrictions, the people who are most affected are the ones with the fewest resources,” said Rachel Jones, a researcher at Guttmacher.
There are a number of possible reasons for why this is happening.
One is purely demographic: The population of women living below the federal poverty level — around $25,750 for a family of four in 2019 — has grown faster than it has among women living above it, Professor Foster said.
That means there are simply more poor women subject to the risk of unwanted pregnancy who may turn to an abortion.
At the same time, women with higher incomes may have better access to highly effective contraception than before, Ms. Jones said.
Another possible reason: There are more financial resources for low-income women to pay for abortion.
Ms. Jones noted that an uptick in charities that offer financial help has made it possible for more women to afford an abortion.
Also, Medicaid expanded in several states under the Affordable Care Act, increasing coverage for poor women, and in turn, coverage of abortion in states that allow their Medicaid programs to pay for it.
At Hope Clinic for Women, in Granite City, Ill.
, just across the Mississippi River from Missouri and a quick drive from downtown St. Louis, more than half of all patients require some financial help.
Many call the National Abortion Federation Hotline Fund, a national nonprofit that gives out small grants, often of a few hundred dollars, to help women pay for abortions and sometimes for travel.
They also get help from the Gateway Women’s Access Fund, a local charity set up in 2015 to help Missouri patients.
That is what helped a young woman from St. Louis, who arrived at the clinic for an appointment last Friday.
She had with her $560, part of which she had saved from her job answering phones on a hospital switchboard.
But when she was told she needed another hundred dollars because of her blood type, she began rapidly texting, hoping she could borrow it.
She even called her mother, something she said she didn’t want to do.
“I’m short $100, can you lend it to us?” she asked her mother, in a quiet voice.
The crisis passed when a clinic worker, Cali Baublitz, said she could cover it using money from the Gateway fund.
As the number of abortions has declined, the map of abortion access across the country has become uneven, with red states passing ever-stricter laws and blue states moving in the opposite direction.
Missouri is now one of six states with only one clinic left.
The others are Kentucky, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota and West Virginia.
That has created surges in adjacent states, and at border clinics like Hope, whose patient load was up by 35 percent this June, compared to the same month a year ago, according to Dr. Erin King, the clinic’s executive director.
Hope Clinic in Illinois is busy, but that is mainly because the only clinic left in Missouri, run by a Planned Parenthood affiliate in St. Louis, is even busier.
That clinic has been on the verge of closing the last several weeks in a fight with state health authorities.
One 30-year-old woman came to Hope because the wait at the Missouri clinic was so long that it would have put her past her 10-week mark, the latest point at which she could get her preferred method of care: a medication abortion, which involves pills, not surgery.
Part of the growing divide among states is financial.
Federal Medicaid funds can only be used for abortion in extremely limited circumstances.
But some states, like California and New York, have gone their own way, allowing state funds to cover the procedure.
Illinois joined those ranks in 2017, and now the overwhelming majority of Hope Clinic patients calling the National Abortion Federation for funding are residents of Missouri, a state that does not allow Medicaid to cover abortion.
The result is a substantially lighter burden for poor women in states that do allow Medicaid to pay — approximately 16 as of June, when Maine joined the list.
Just 25 percent of abortion patients in those states paid out of pocket for care, according to Guttmacher, compared to 75 percent of abortion patients in states where Medicaid does not pay.
In those states, charities have become a significant part of how women pay for abortion.
The National Abortion Federation’s office in Washington, D.C. buzzes with the sound of ringing phones as young people wearing headsets answer calls from abortion patients from around the country.
The hotline, the largest of its kind in the nation, will employ 36 full-time workers by the end of this month, up from 22 in 2011, said Melissa Fowler, a spokeswoman for the organization.
Last year, the fund provided financial assistance for approximately 85,000 women seeking abortion care, she said, a figure that was down slightly from 2017, after Illinois, the fifth most-populous state, began covering the procedure through Medicaid.
“The phone is always ringing,” said Charlene Sumter, who answers patients’ first calls into the hotline.
“There’s never a moment of silence.
” Patients interviewed at Hope last week attested to their reliance on the hotline.
“I called every day for a week straight,” said a 27-year-old named Alex, who had driven two hours from her home in northeast Missouri, and did not want to give her last name because she was worried people in her small town would recognize her.
She said she was never able to get through, though that might have been because she only called at certain times in order not to be overheard by her son, who is five, or her employers whose houses she cleans.
In the end, she borrowed $560 from friends.
“I wouldn’t be here today without them,” she said.
Her morning had been chaotic.
Her ride bailed and so did her babysitter.
She got a flat, which she changed on the side of the road.
Still, the word she used to describe her mood was “determined.
” She said she had been in an abusive relationship for years, and had escaped, with her son, and was trying to start a new life by saving money for college.
“I can’t carry a child for nine months right now, I just can’t,” she said, sitting in a quiet room at Hope clinic, a two-story brick building with a busy lobby.
“I have to give my son the best life I can.
I have to go to college.

83,1777809,"['legislative', 'executive', 'report', 'mueller']","WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary Committee voted Wednesday to recommend the House hold Attorney General William P. Barr in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over Robert S. Mueller III’s unredacted report, hours after President Trump asserted executive privilege to shield the full report and underlying evidence from Congress.
The committee’s 24-to-16 contempt vote, taken after hours of debate that featured ominous language about the future of American democracy, was the first time that the House took official action to punish a government official amid a standoff between the legislative and executive branches.
The Justice Department denounced it as an unnecessary and overwrought reaction meant to stoke a fight.
The drama raised the stakes yet again in an increasingly tense battle over evidence and witnesses as Democrats investigate Mr. Trump and his administration to judge whether to hold the president to account for behavior detailed by Mr. Mueller, the special counsel.
By the day’s end, it seemed all but inevitable that the competing claims would have to be settled in the nation’s courts rather than on Capitol Hill, as Democrats had initially hoped after the delivery of Mr. Mueller’s report last month.
“Our fight is not just about the Mueller report — although we must have access to the Mueller report,” Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the Judiciary Committee chairman, said during a grueling debate.
“Our fight is about defending the rights of Congress, as an independent branch, to hold the president, any president, accountable.
” After the vote concluded, he swatted away questions about possible impeachment, but added, “We are now in a constitutional crisis.
” The Justice Department, the White House and House Republicans lined up to contest that claim, shooting back that Democrats were the ones abusing their powers to manufacture a crisis.
In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, Kerri Kupec, deplored the contempt vote as “politically motivated and unnecessary,” and the two sides traded blame over who had cut off weeks of negotiations over a possible compromise.
“Regrettably, Chairman Nadler’s actions have prematurely terminated the accommodation process and forced the president to assert executive privilege to preserve the status quo,” Ms. Kupec said.
“No one, including Chairman Nadler and his committee, will force the Department of Justice to break the law.
” Though Mr. Trump has repeatedly tried to withhold information from Congress, and pledged an across-the-board objection to House subpoenas, the executive privilege assertion is his first use of the secrecy powers as president.
The Justice Department, which asked the president to step in, described the claim as “protective” to allow Mr. Trump time to fully review the materials to make a final privilege determination.
But the timing of the assertion signaled that the White House was eager for a fight.
“The American people see through Chairman Nadler’s desperate ploy to distract from the president’s historically successful agenda and our booming economy,” said the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
It was not immediately clear when the full House would vote, and the intervening period could allow Mr. Barr time to negotiate.
Mr. Nadler said he expected a House vote “rapidly.
” After a contempt vote, the House was likely to file a lawsuit seeking to enforce their subpoena, but the ensuing legal process could take years, effectively stalling Democrats’ quest.
Passage of such a resolution would be only the second time in American history that the nation’s top law enforcement official is found to be in contempt of Congress.
[Read the letter Mr. Barr wrote to Mr. Trump on executive privilege.
] The Judiciary Committee was not the only House panel locked in conflict over the material.
During the contempt hearing on Wednesday, the Intelligence Committee quietly sent the Justice Department its own subpoena for the full Mueller report and underlying evidence, as well as any counterintelligence and foreign intelligence material generated during the special counsel investigation.
The panel likewise blamed the department for failing to accommodate its bipartisan oversight interest in the material and argued that as the body that oversees the intelligence community, it had special authorities to view the secretive material.
“The law is on our side,” said the committee’s chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California.
“The committee’s efforts to obtain necessary documents to do our constitutionally-mandated oversight work will not be obstructed.
” Mr. Barr voluntarily released last month a redacted version of the special counsel’s 448-page report, which concluded that despite ample efforts by the Kremlin, the Trump campaign did not conspire with Russia to undermine the 2016 presidential election.
Mr. Mueller also laid out at least 10 instances of possible obstruction of justice, and said he could not make a traditional judgment because of various legal constraints.
But Democrats say Mr. Barr’s version is not good enough, and they have accused the attorney general of stonewalling a legitimate request for material they need to pick up an investigation into possible obstruction of justice and abuse of power by Mr. Trump.
The Democrats’ request includes secretive grand jury information and other evidence.
The committee’s 27-page contempt report lays out the panel’s need for the report and offers an accounting of attempts to get Mr. Barr to share the materials first voluntarily and then under subpoena.
The Justice Department had tried to stave off the committee vote, offering to lawmakers some concessions around a less redacted version of the Mueller report, which omitted only grand jury material.
Democrats deemed the offer insufficient.
The Justice Department had other objections to the subpoena.
Compliance would require the department to violate “the law, court rules and court orders” as well as grand jury secrecy rules, a Justice Department official, Stephen E. Boyd, wrote.
Republicans on the committee seized on that point to accuse Democrats of forcing Mr. Barr to choose between complying with their subpoena or the law.
But Democrats said they did not expect Mr. Barr to break the law and unilaterally release grand jury secrets, but rather to join them in petitioning a judge to unseal material for the grand jury for committee use.
Mr. Nadler said after the vote that Democrats intended to go to the judge on their own authority.
Democrats view the president’s executive privilege claim as nonsense, since much of the report and evidence has either been released publicly or shared with lawyers.
Still, Mr. Trump’s invocation of privilege could tie up the material in court and significantly complicate Democrats’ efforts to call other witnesses.
Mr. Nadler said Wednesday it could delay a potential hearing with Mr. Mueller in the Judiciary Committee.
And it could also limit testimony by Donald F. McGahn II, a former White House counsel and key witness in the special counsel’s investigation, scheduled under subpoena for May
21. Democrats’ frustration in the hearing room was clear.
“I can only conclude that the president now seeks to take a wrecking ball to the Constitution of the United States of America,” Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas said.
Republicans rose one after another to defend the attorney general and urge the Democrats to turn their investigative focus to the origins of what they see as a special counsel investigation cooked up to smear the president.
Representative Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, who was one of the “managers” of President Bill Clinton’s impeachment, criticized Democrats for lending support to a “character assassination squad running around this town” sullying innocent people.
There is little precedent for holding an attorney general in contempt.
House Republicans did it for the first time in 2012, for Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., in connection with requests for information about the botched “Fast and Furious” gun trafficking investigation.
Republicans cited that case frequently on Wednesday in an effort to paint Democrats as unreasonable.
They had waited hundreds of days before escalating their fight over documents to a contempt citation, they said.
Democrats waited just a few weeks in the instance of Mr. Barr.
“Why this rush?” asked Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the committee.
“Without any valid legislative or administrative reason, we can only assume Democrats, led by the chairman, have resolved to sully Bill Barr’s good name and reputation.
” The example is a potentially cautionary one for both sides.
Despite President Barack Obama’s assertion of executive privilege over the material in questions, House lawmakers ultimately prevailed in court, forcing the administration to hand over the evidence.
But the process took years to play out and could have taken longer if the Obama administration had appealed a court’s decision.
In this case, a contempt citation does not guarantee an outcome Democrats want.
While defying a congressional subpoena is technically a misdemeanor crime, it is up to the Justice Department to decide whether to prosecute.
And though Democrats have mused in recent weeks about the authority of the House to apply punishments, including fines and detention, those outcomes have little modern precedent and are unlikely to actually be pursued.
Instead, a contempt citation would effectively push the dispute into the courts, where a judge could decide whether to force the administration to hand over the material.
But that process would be lengthy, especially with Democrats likely to turn to the courts in a range of other disputes over Mr. Trump’s tax returns and over other potential witnesses to the obstruction investigation.

There is little precedent for holding an attorney general in contempt.
House Republicans did it for the first time in 2012, for Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., in connection with requests for information about the botched “Fast and Furious” gun trafficking investigation.
Republicans cited that case frequently on Wednesday in an effort to paint Democrats as unreasonable.
They had waited hundreds of days before escalating their fight over documents to a contempt citation, they said.
Democrats waited just a few weeks in the instance of Mr. Barr.
“Why this rush?” asked Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the committee.
“Without any valid legislative or administrative reason, we can only assume Democrats, led by the chairman, have resolved to sully Bill Barr’s good name and reputation.
” The example is a potentially cautionary one for both sides.
Despite President Barack Obama’s assertion of executive privilege over the material in questions, House lawmakers ultimately prevailed in court, forcing the administration to hand over the evidence.
But the process took years to play out and could have taken longer if the Obama administration had appealed a court’s decision.
In this case, a contempt citation does not guarantee an outcome Democrats want.
While defying a congressional subpoena is technically a misdemeanor crime, it is up to the Justice Department to decide whether to prosecute.
And though Democrats have mused in recent weeks about the authority of the House to apply punishments, including fines and detention, those outcomes have little modern precedent and are unlikely to actually be pursued.
Instead, a contempt citation would effectively push the dispute into the courts, where a judge could decide whether to force the administration to hand over the material.
But that process would be lengthy, especially with Democrats likely to turn to the courts in a range of other disputes over Mr. Trump’s tax returns and over other potential witnesses to the obstruction investigation.

84,1778045,"[' ballistic missile', 'north korea', 'united states', 'time', 'launched 4:30', '4:30 pm', 'Strategic studies']","SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea fired a projectile toward the east on Thursday, its second such weapons test in less than a week, the South Korean military said.
The launch came just five days after North Korea fired several short-range projectiles off its east coast.
They flew 70 to 200 kilometers before landing in the sea between North Korea and Japan, the South Korean military said then in a statement.
The projectile Thursday was launched from near the North’s west coast, at Sino-ri, about 50 miles northwest of Pyongyang, the capital, the South Korean military said in a statement.
It gave no further details, including what type of projectile it was or how far it flew.
It was launched at about 4:30 p.m. local time.
The North’s missile base in Sino-ri is believed to operate Rodong short- and medium-range ballistic missiles.
Some Western missile experts say the Sino-ri base may have played a role in the development of the North’s Pukguksong-2 ballistic missile, which was first tested in February 2017.
Unlike most of North Korea’s ballistic missiles, the Pukguksong-2 uses solid fuel, making it easier to transport and hide and faster to launch.
“The Sino-ri missile operating base and the Rodong missiles deployed at this location fit into North Korea’s presumed nuclear military strategy by providing an operational-level nuclear or conventional first-strike capability against targets located both throughout the Korean Peninsula and in most of Japan,” analysts for the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, said in a paper in January.
South Korean officials were still analyzing flight data on Thursday to determine the range of the weapon that North Korea launched.
But the short-range projectiles it fired on Saturday did not violate a moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests that the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, declared in April of last year.
But the Saturday tests may have included at least one ballistic missile, which would violate United Nations Security Council resolutions that bar North Korea from testing any ballistic missile technology, analysts said.
[How North Korea's weapons test Saturday threatened President Trump’s diplomatic achievement.
] Japan said shortly after the launch on Thursday that no North Korean projectile had landed in its territorial waters.
“At the moment, we don’t see any situation that would immediately impact on Japan’s security,” its Defense Ministry said in a statement.
The recent launches come about two months after Mr. Kim met for the second time with President Trump, hoping to win relief from punishing sanctions in return for a partial dismantlement of his country’s nuclear weapons program.
But that meeting, in Hanoi, Vietnam, collapsed after Mr. Trump refused to lift sanctions until North Korea relinquished all its nuclear weapons.
Stephen Biegun, Mr. Trump’s point man on North Korea, was in Seoul on Thursday for talks with South Korean officials on how to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table.
Mr. Biegun has been widely expected to discuss humanitarian food aid that South Korea plans to provide to the North as an incentive.
[President Trump supports food aid for North Korea, the South says.] The North’s weapons tests in recent days have been the most serious since the country launched an intercontinental ballistic missile in November 2017.
The Saturday launches were largely seen as an attempt to increase pressure on Washington to return to talks with a more flexible proposal following the breakdown of the summit meeting in Hanoi.
North Korean and American officials have since been unable to resume negotiations.
The choice to launch short-range projectiles suggested that Mr. Kim had not given up hope on resuming negotiations, analysts said.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited Mr. Kim’s moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests as a reason to continue talks with North Korea.
North Korea is “incrementally increasing the magnitude of the test to try to increase the momentum” of any future diplomatic talks, said Michael Bosack, a special adviser for government relations at the Yokosuka Council on Asia Pacific Studies in Japan.
With the United States still indicating that it is willing to continue talks, Mr. Kim is “posturing for what’s going to happen when they get there,” Mr. Bosack said.
“The U.S. has not said ‘if you keep doing this we’re cutting off talks.
’ Even after this last test this past weekend, the response from the U.S. was ‘we still want to talk,’ so this is to generate urgency and improve his position at the negotiating table.
” After the launches on Saturday, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that Mr. Kim “knows that I am with him &
does not want to break his promise to me.
Deal will happen!”
","SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea launched two short-range ballistic missiles on Thursday, the South Korean military said, an escalation from the North’s most recent weapons test just five days ago.
The two missiles were launched eastward from the country’s northwest, with one flying 260 miles and the other about 170 miles, the military said in a statement.
It said officials from the South and the United States were jointly analyzing flight data to determine what type of missiles they were.
“Our military has stepped up our surveillance and monitoring in preparation for possible additional launches by North Korea,” the statement said.
“We remain fully prepared in close coordination with the United States.
” The statement did not say where the missiles had landed, but the reported distances would put them in the sea between North Korea and Japan.
The launch came five days after North Korea fired several short-range projectiles off its east coast.
They flew 43 to 125 miles before landing in the sea, the South Korean military said then in a statement.
Japan said on Thursday that the two missiles had not landed in its territorial waters.
“At the moment, we don’t see any situation that would immediately impact on Japan’s security,” its Defense Ministry said in a statement.
The South Korean military first said the missiles were fired from Sino-ri, home to a North Korean ballistic missile base.
But it later amended that, saying they had been launched from Kusong, a town north of Sino-ri.
North Korea has frequently launched missiles from Kusong, including its first solid-fuel midrange ballistic missile, known as Pukguksong-2, which it launched from there in February 2017.
The Pukguksong-2 test marked a major leap forward for the North because the missile used solid fuel, which makes it easier to hide, transport and launch and harder for the United States to target in a pre-emptive strike.
Ko Min-jung, a spokeswoman for President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, called the Thursday launches “a very disturbing development,” adding, “This does not help at all efforts to improve South-North Korean relations and ease military tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
” Like the test on Saturday, the missile launches on Thursday did not violate a moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests that the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, declared in April of last year.
But launching any kind of ballistic missile, including short-range missiles, violates United Nations Security Council resolutions that bar North Korea from testing such technology, analysts said.
The tests on Saturday may also have involved at least one ballistic missile.

But that meeting, in Hanoi, Vietnam, collapsed after Mr. Trump refused to lift sanctions until North Korea relinquished all of its nuclear weapons.
Mr. Kim had wanted the most punishing sanctions lifted in exchange for only a partial dismantlement of its nuclear program.
The launch Thursday came as Stephen Biegun, Mr. Trump’s point man on North Korea, was in Seoul for talks with South Korean officials on how to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table.
Mr. Biegun had been expected to discuss food aid that South Korea plans to provide to the North as an incentive.
A North Korea expert in Seoul, Lee Byong-chul, said the timing was no coincidence.
“With this launching, North Korea is making clear that it is demanding more than the mere humanitarian food aid South Korea and the United States are discussing,” said Mr. Lee, of the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University.

” After the launches on Saturday, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that Mr. Kim “knows that I am with him &
does not want to break his promise to me.
Deal will happen!” One of the projectiles the North launched on Saturday appeared to be the Russian Iskander short-range ballistic missile, which can make course corrections during its flight, making it difficult to shoot down with ballistic-missile defenses, according to missile experts.
Michael Elleman, interim director of the Non-Proliferation and Nuclear Policy Program at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said North Korea may have imported the missile directly from Moscow or through a third party.
“Regardless of the origins of North Korea’s newest short-range ballistic missile, its appearance and testing provide convincing evidence that Pyongyang continues to seek greater military and strategic capabilities,” Mr. Elleman wrote in a paper posted this week on 38 North, a website specializing in North Korea.
“If little progress is made in the negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang in the near to mid-term future, expect to see the unveiling of more, increasingly capable strategic weapons and capabilities.

85,1809373,"['Justice Stevens', 'district Columbia', 'Columbia v', 'suffered small', 'small stroke']","John Paul Stevens, whose 35 years on the United States Supreme Court transformed him, improbably, from a Republican antitrust lawyer to the outspoken leader of the court’s liberal wing, died Tuesday at a hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
He was
99. The cause was complications from a stroke he suffered the day before, the Supreme Court announced in a statement.
When he retired in 2010 at the age of 90, Justice Stevens was the second-oldest and the second-longest-serving justice ever to sit on the court.
Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. was about eight months older when he retired in 1932, and William O. Douglas had served 36 years (1939-75).
Justice Stevens had spent much of his service on the court in the shadow of more readily definable colleagues when he emerged as a central figure during a crucial period of the court’s history: The last phase of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist’s tenure and the early years under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.
It was a time when the court took an active role in balancing individual liberty and national security and in policing the constitutional separation of powers, asserting a muscular brand of judicial authority that was welcomed by neither the White House nor Congress.
Societal debates over the rights of gay men and lesbians, the role of race, private property rights, environmental regulation and the separation of church and state also made their way onto the Supreme Court’s docket, and Justice Stevens, a soft-spoken Republican and former antitrust lawyer from Chicago, was as surprised as anyone to find himself not only taking the liberal side but also becoming its ardent champion.
It was Justice Stevens who wrote the court’s majority opinion in Rasul v.
Bush, in 2004, which brought within the jurisdiction of the federal courts the hundreds of prisoners who had been captured as enemy combatants during the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan and held at the United States Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.
It was Justice Stevens who wrote the majority opinion in Hamdan v.
Rumsfeld, in 2006, which repudiated the Bush administration’s plan to put some of those detainees on trial by military commissions.
“The Executive is bound to comply with the Rule of Law that prevails in this jurisdiction,” he declared.
On the domestic side, in 2002, it was Justice Stevens who wrote the opinion in Atkins v.
Virginia, declaring that the Constitution does not permit executing the mentally disabled.
Such defendants “face a special risk of wrongful execution,” he said, because of their limited ability to understand their actions and participate in their own defense.
Justice Antonin Scalia’s dissenting opinion in that case provided an example of how deeply divided the court was during those years on both methodology and outcomes.
He complained that the 6-to-3 majority had simply enshrined its own views as constitutional law.
“The arrogance of this assumption of power takes one’s breath away,” Justice Scalia wrote.
Two years before that, Justice Stevens had his own turn at a bitter dissent, in Bush v.
Gore, the case that effectively decided the 2000 presidential election by stopping the Florida recount.
Justice Stevens, one of four dissenters, said the court’s action “can only lend credence to the most cynical appraisal of the work of judges throughout the land.
” He said that although the actual winner of the presidential election might remain unknown, “the identity of the loser is perfectly clear”: It was “the nation’s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.
” As the senior associate justice, with the power to assign majority opinions whenever he was in the majority and the chief justice was in dissent, Justice Stevens was the field marshal for a series of decisions that achieved liberal victories late in Chief Justice Rehnquist’s tenure.
He assigned opinions to others in favor of gay rights and affirmative action and kept for himself decisions that upheld the authority of the federal government in the face of what had appeared to be the unstoppable states’-rights tilt of the Rehnquist court’s federalism revolution.
Until this final period, Justice Stevens had been known to the public, if at all, primarily for the jaunty bow ties he usually wore.
His reputation was that of a very smart, nonideological, slightly quirky loner who, if a case was decided by a vote of 8 to 1, was as likely as not to be the solitary dissenter, caring neither to lead nor to follow.
He became the senior associate justice in his 19th year on the court, upon the retirement of Justice Harry A. Blackmun in 1994.
The role, which he appeared to enjoy, heightened his visibility and showed the world what his colleagues already knew: that he was actually a strategic thinker and canny tactician whose genial personality and impressive analytic power could forge a path that might have appeared blocked by the sheer arithmetic of a majority that was well to his right.
His frequent dissenting opinions, he said, arose from a conviction that both the public and the law were best served when differing views were expressed and explained, rather than suppressed for the sake of surface collegiality.
The court’s ideological spectrum was quite different when John Paul Stevens arrived from the federal appeals court in Chicago in December 1975, named by President Gerald R. Ford to replace Justice Douglas, who had retired a month earlier.
The liberal titans William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall were still sitting.
So was Lewis F. Powell Jr., an appointee of President Richard M. Nixon, who voted with the conservatives on criminal law issues but stoutly defended abortion rights.
Another colleague was Potter Stewart, the last of President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s four Supreme Court appointees and, like Justice Stevens, a moderate Republican from the Midwest.
Only five years apart in age despite Justice Stewart’s substantial seniority, the two men bonded.
In a speech in 2004, Justice Stevens said that Justice Stewart, who retired in 1981 and died four years later, “probably had the keenest intellect of any judge with whom I have served.
” The court’s membership turned over completely and moved indisputably to the right during Justice Stevens’s long tenure on the bench.
The extent to which it bridged two eras of Supreme Court history was underscored on Oct. 3, 2005, when he administered the oath of office to Chief Justice Roberts, a man 35 years his junior whom he had first met 25 years earlier, when Justice Stevens was the court’s most junior member and John Roberts was a law clerk.
But the emergence of John Paul Stevens as the court’s most liberal justice was not simply a result of standing still amid a shifting landscape.
His own views changed over time, moving to the left, particularly on the death penalty and on questions of racially conscious government policies.
He was skeptical of such policies at first, voting with the conservatives in the 1978 Bakke case to invalidate an admissions program at a University of California medical school that had set aside 16 places for minority applicants out of an entering class of 100.
The court ordered the medical school to admit Allan Bakke, the white applicant who had brought the case.
Two years later, when the Supreme Court upheld a set-aside program that reserved 10 percent of federal public works money for minority contractors, Justice Stevens was one of three dissenters, along with Justices Stewart and Rehnquist.
In his dissenting opinion in that case, Fullilove v.
Klutznick, he warned that the “slapdash statute,” as he described it, could become “a permanent source of justification for grants of special privileges.
” In 1989, he voted with the 6-to-3 majority that invalidated a 30 percent minority contracting set-aside program in the city of Richmond, Va.
Justices Marshall, Brennan and Blackmun dissented, with Justice Blackmun commenting, “I never thought that I would live to see the day” when the former “cradle of the Old Confederacy” would adopt a plan to help its African-American residents overcome a legacy of discrimination, only to see the effort struck down by “this court, the supposed bastion of equality.
” Nonetheless, Justice Stevens’s nuanced separate opinion in that case, Richmond v.
J.A.
Croson Company, demonstrated that he had begun to distance himself from the court’s increasingly conservative center of gravity.
He agreed that the Richmond ordinance had painted with too broad a brush.
But he did not agree with the majority’s premise that “a racial classification is never permissible except as a remedy for a past wrong”;
sometimes such a classification is permissible, he said, if it takes account of race as a policy tool for building a better future.
He had said as much in a dissenting opinion in 1986 in a case challenging a collective bargaining agreement that shielded African-American teachers against layoffs in a Michigan public school district.
The agreement was meant to preserve a hard-won racial balance in an economically troubled district, where the recently hired minority teachers would have been most vulnerable to seniority-based layoffs.
The 5-to-4 majority in that case, Wygant v.
Jackson Board of Education, concluded that the policy violated the white teachers’ 14th Amendment right to equal protection.
Justice Powell explained that there was no proof of past discrimination for which the policy could be justified as an appropriate remedy.
In dissent, Justice Stevens said the majority’s mistake was to look backward rather than forward.
Rather than ask whether the policy could be justified “as a remedy for sins that were committed in the past,” he said, “I believe that we should first ask whether the board’s action advances the public interest in educating children for the future.
” In a speech in 2004, Justice Stevens reflected on the “especially close” relationship he had enjoyed with Justice Powell, despite their differences in the Wygant case.
He recalled that as the case was about to be argued, it came up in casual conversation between them.
“We both remarked on the fact that our next affirmative action argument was in an ‘easy case,’” Justice Stevens said.
“It was only later that we both learned that we thought it easy for opposite reasons.
” His views on the death penalty similarly evolved.
He arrived at the Supreme Court in the aftermath of the 1972 Furman v.
Georgia decision, which invalidated every death penalty statute in the country.
The urgent question was whether a new generation of statutes that most states had enacted in response to the Furman ruling would now meet the court’s approval.
In 1976, in Gregg v.
Georgia, the newly appointed Justice Stevens voted with the 5-to-4 majority to endorse the new approach, which required special procedures to “channel” the jury’s discretion and to allow the resumption of capital punishment.
With the passing years, however, Justice Stevens began to express deep concerns about how the death penalty was being administered.
Recent evidence that “a substantial number of death sentences have been imposed erroneously” was “profoundly significant,” he told the American Bar Association in 2005, “because it indicates that there must be serious flaws in our administration of criminal justice.
” Finally, in 2008, he renounced capital punishment expressly, declaring that the time had come to reconsider “the justification for the death penalty itself.
” Too often, he said, court decisions and actions taken by states to justify the death penalty were “the product of habit and inattention rather than an acceptable deliberative process.
” The case was Baze v.
Rees, a constitutional challenge to Kentucky’s method of execution by lethal injection.
A majority rejected the challenge, and Justice Stevens concurred in that result, writing that he felt bound to “respect precedents that remain a part of our law.
” But he had made himself clear: in the court’s hands the death penalty had become, for him, a promise of fairness unfulfilled.
One plausible explanation for Justice Stevens’s growing affinity for the liberal side was his response to the polarizing discourse about the Supreme Court that emanated from the administration of President Ronald Reagan in the mid-1980s.
After Attorney General Edwin Meese III criticized a long series of Supreme Court precedents that had interpreted the Bill of Rights as binding not only on the federal government but on the states as well — a foundational premise of 20th-century constitutional law — Justice Stevens took him on directly.
The attorney general, he said in a speech to the Federal Bar Association in Chicago in 1985, “overlooks the profound importance of the Civil War and the postwar amendments on the structure of our government.
” Justice Stevens’s own explanation for why his views had changed was simply that he had learned on the job.
“I know that I, like most of my colleagues, have continued to participate in a learning process while serving on the bench,” he said in 2005 at a symposium held at Fordham University Law School to mark his 30th anniversary on the court and 35th year as a judge.
“Learning on the job is essential to the process of judging,” he continued.
“At the very least, I know that learning on the bench has been one of the most important and rewarding aspects of my own experience over the last 35 years.
” Yet in another sense he did not change very much, remaining what he had been at the start of his judicial career: a judge who looked at the facts on the ground rather than theories in law review articles, one who tended to regard doctrinal debates as a distraction from a judge’s real work, which in his opinion was the application of judgment to the case at hand.
His distinctive approach to the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection was perhaps the best example of his disdain for doctrinal formalism.
By the mid-1970s, the court had developed an elaborate grid for evaluating claims of unequal treatment at the hands of the government.
Policies that distinguished among people based on their race were subject to “strict” judicial scrutiny and were almost never upheld.
Policies that simply concerned economic interests were subject to minimal scrutiny and were upheld as long as they had a “rational basis.
” Policies that treated men and women differently fell somewhere in between, subject to “heightened” judicial scrutiny and required to serve an “important governmental interest.
” Justice Stevens rejected all this.
“There is only one Equal Protection Clause,” he declared in 1976, concurring in Craig v.
Boren, an early sex discrimination case.
“It requires every state to govern impartially.
” A straightforward application of that principle was all a court needed, in his view, to decide an equal protection case.
One of Justice Stevens’s former clerks, Andrew M. Siegel, a law professor at the University of South Carolina, summed up the justice’s jurisprudence in a paper delivered at the 2005 Fordham symposium.
“Perhaps the defining vision of Justice Stevens’s jurisprudence, indeed of his entire life project,” Professor Siegel wrote, “has been an unshakable faith in the capacity of men and women of the law to resolve difficult and contentious issues through the application of reason tempered by experience and humility.
” Professor William D. Popkin of the Indiana University School of Law wrote in a 1989 article in The Duke Law Journal that “a special brand of judicial restraint and creativity” marked Justice Stevens’s approach to the law.
Justice Stevens was guided by three principles, Professor Popkin wrote: first, “deference to other decision makers,” based on the view that “the court should not decide cases that other institutions can decide at least as well or better”;
second, attention to the facts of a case and avoidance of broad generalizations, based on the view that “the court should decide no more than the facts of the case require”;
and third, the belief that the court’s highest substantive goal was to “protect individual dignity,” as reflected in his approach to equal protection.
Justice Stevens gave concrete application to his view of a limited role for the courts in one of his most important majority opinions, the 1984 case Chevron v.
Natural Resources Defense Council.
The court held that when a federal statute is ambiguous, judges should generally defer to the interpretation of the agency charged with administering that statute rather than impose their own views of what Congress must have or should have meant.
“Federal judges — who have no constituency — have a duty to respect legitimate policy choices made by those who do,” Justice Stevens wrote.
Although the case remained obscure to the general public, it was a landmark of administrative law, and the term “Chevron deference” became a commonplace in judicial decisions reviewing a seemingly endless array of federal regulations.
For the rest of his career, Justice Stevens looked back on the Chevron case with fondness and pride.
But while believing that judicial deference was often appropriate, he also believed that the federal courts must be available when other institutions of government failed to do their jobs.
“I firmly believe that the Framers of the Constitution expected and intended the vast open spaces in our charter of government to be filled not only by legislative enactment but also by the common-law process of step-by-step adjudication,” he said in a 1991 speech at the University of Chicago.
That university was his alma mater, and his family had deep roots in Chicago.
John Paul Stevens was born there on April 20, 1920, and grew up in a Georgian-style house in the Hyde Park neighborhood.
He was the fourth son and youngest child of Ernest James Stevens, a wealthy businessman with interests in real estate and insurance, and the former Elizabeth Street, an English teacher.
In 1909 his grandfather, James W. Stevens, an ambitious and successful financier, had built what was then Chicago’s biggest hotel, the LaSalle.
His appetite whetted, the older Stevens then formed the family-owned Stevens Hotel Company to build and operate the world’s biggest hotel, a blocklong, 28-story, 3,000-room behemoth on Michigan Avenue that opened in 1927 as the Stevens Hotel.
Charles Lindbergh and Amelia Earhart were among the many celebrities the young John Paul Stevens met there.
Those early encounters may have inspired him;
he became an avid pilot himself, flying his single-engine Cessna 172 around the Midwest for many years.
The Depression ended his grandfather’s dream in a disastrous way.
Not only did the family lose the hotel, which was eventually bought by Conrad Hilton and stands today as the Hilton Chicago, but John’s grandfather, father and uncle were indicted by a Cook County grand jury on charges of looting the family’s insurance business in a failed effort to keep the hotel afloat.
Facing extreme stress, his grandfather had a severe stroke, while his uncle, Raymond Stevens, fell into a depression and committed suicide.
Only Justice Stevens’s father went to trial, and he was convicted in 1933 of embezzling $1.3 million.
The conviction was overturned the next year by the Illinois Supreme Court, which decided that Ernest Stevens’s actions had not amounted to a crime;
he had used bad judgment, the court said, but had acted in good faith in trying to save the hotel, without intending either to commit fraud or to enrich himself.
With his father making a modest living managing a hotel for someone else, John attended the University of Chicago, where he majored in English and edited the newspaper.
He graduated in 1941 as a member of Phi Beta Kappa and winner of the university’s highest honors for scholarship and student activities.
He was commissioned as an officer in the Navy on Dec. 6, 1941, the day before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
He spent most of his Navy service, which lasted until 1945, stationed at Pearl Harbor working on breaking Japanese codes, for which he was awarded the Bronze Star.
In 1942 he married Elizabeth Jane Sheeren, with whom he had a son and three daughters.
The couple divorced in 1979, and Justice Stevens married Maryan Mulholland Simon, a dietitian, the next year.
She died in 2015.
His son, John Joseph, died of cancer in 1996, and his daughter Kathryn preceded him in death.
He is survived by two daughters, Elizabeth Jane Sesemann and Susan Roberta Mullen, nine grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.
With two older brothers who were lawyers, John was encouraged after his discharge from the Navy to attend law school himself.
He used the G.I.
Bill to attend Northwestern University Law School, where he completed his degree in two years.
He was editor in chief of the law review and graduated first in the class of 1947 with the highest grade-point average in the school’s history.
A Supreme Court clerkship was a natural sequel.
He spent the court’s 1947-48 term as a law clerk to Justice Wiley B. Rutledge, a respected former law professor and dean who was President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s last Supreme Court appointee.
Justice Rutledge, who died of a stroke at 55 in 1949, cutting short his service on the court after six years, influenced his young protégé profoundly.
Justice Rutledge viewed himself as an old-fashioned “common law” judge who decided cases one at a time.
He was a liberal and, while committed to a strong national government, was also an internationalist;
in 1948 he dissented on behalf of a group of German-born United States residents challenging the government’s right to deport them.
Justice Rutledge had “great faith in wisdom born of experience and mistrusted untried statements of general principles,” Mr. Stevens wrote in an admiring essay in the mid-1950s, years before his own judicial career began.
Decades later, in writing the court’s opinion that gave the Guantánamo detainees access to federal court, Justice Stevens took great pleasure in vindicating his old boss’s position in the 1948 case, Ahrens v.
Clark.
And in rejecting the Bush administration’s plan for military commissions, Justice Stevens cited another dissent by Justice Rutledge, from 1946, in which he argued on behalf of habeas corpus for a Japanese general, Tomoyuki Yamashita, who had been sentenced to death by a military commission.
After his Supreme Court clerkship, Mr. Stevens returned to Chicago to begin what would be a 22-year career in private practice.
Although he had always been known simply as John Stevens, he began adding his middle name when signing legal pleadings to add something extra to his bland first and last names.
The full name eventually became part of his professional identity.
He handled regulatory and antitrust cases at one of the city’s most prominent firms, Poppenhusen, Johnston, Thompson &
Raymond, now known as Jenner &
Block.
After three years there, he and two other junior associates left to start their own firm, Rothschild, Stevens, Barry &
Myers.
He remained there until 1970, when Senator Charles H. Percy, an Illinois Republican who had been a University of Chicago classmate, proposed that the Nixon administration nominate him for a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the federal appeals court based in Chicago.
He was a reluctant nominee, at first urging Senator Percy to ask him again in six years.
“I told John,” Mr. Percy later recalled, “if you wait six years, I may not be senator and there may not be a Republican president.
And in that time you could be on the Supreme Court.
” John Stevens had become prominent in Chicago legal circles, if not among the public at large, for his role in a riveting political drama the previous year: an ethics scandal involving two members of the Illinois Supreme Court.
Chief Justice Roy J. Solfisburg and Justice Ray I. Klingbiel were accused by a private citizen of having accepted valuable bank stock from a politically influential Chicago lawyer in exchange for ruling in his favor in a criminal case.
The court set up a special commission to investigate the charge, with Mr. Stevens as its counsel.
He was selected not only because of his good reputation but also because, with a law practice that was based in federal court, he had no ties to the state court bench.
During an intense six-week period, working without compensation in the full glare of a news media spotlight, he organized and led the investigation and presented findings that validated the accusation and led to the resignation of the two justices.
Mr. Stevens won high praise for his efforts and said later that he learned invaluable lessons about how appellate courts work.
The episode became the subject of a book, “Illinois Justice,” by Kenneth A. Manaster, published by the University of Chicago Press in 2001.
Senator Percy proved to be a better prophet than his reluctant nominee could have imagined.
The retirement of Justice Douglas in November 1975 was a potential problem for President Ford, who was about to enter a challenging re-election campaign and did not want the Supreme Court to be a source of controversy.
He asked his attorney general, Edward H. Levi, to find a nominee who would win easy approval.
Mr. Levi, a former dean of the University of Chicago Law School and president of the university, knew Judge Stevens and recommended him highly.
The president acted quickly.
In two weeks the nomination was official, and 19 days later, on Dec. 17, 1975, Justice Stevens was confirmed by a vote of 98 to
0. The only opposition during his three-day confirmation hearing came from several women’s groups, which objected to his dissent from a ruling by the appeals court that it was illegal for an airline to require flight attendants to remain single.
Even though he was the first Supreme Court nominee since the court established the constitutional right to abortion in Roe v.
Wade, nearly three years earlier, he was not asked a single question about abortion during his confirmation hearing.
Thirty years later, on the occasion of Fordham Law School’s anniversary symposium, Ford sent a letter to the school’s dean, William Michael Treanor.
“I am prepared,” the former president wrote, “to allow history’s judgment of my term in office to rest (if necessary, exclusively) on my nomination 30 years ago of Justice John Paul Stevens to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
” Among the positions for which Justice Stevens was best known on the court was his insistence on strict separation of church and state.
“Whenever we remove a brick from the wall that was designed to separate religion and government, we increase the risk of religious strife and weaken the foundation of our democracy,” he wrote in dissent from a 2002 decision that upheld an Ohio program providing taxpayer-financed vouchers for religious school tuition.
In an abortion case in 1989, he was the only justice to take the position that a Missouri statute declaring that life begins at conception not only violated the court’s abortion precedents but also was impermissible as “an unequivocal endorsement of a religious tenet” that “serves no identifiable secular purpose.
” Over the years, he was a strong defender of the court’s precedents defining the right to abortion.
He was also strongly on the federal government’s side in the court’s running debate over the proper allocation of federal and state power.
He wrote the court’s 2005 opinion upholding the power of Congress to prohibit the use of marijuana for medical purposes in California and other states that had chosen to permit it.
Later that year, he told a bar meeting in Las Vegas that while he agreed with “the policy choice made by millions of California voters,” it was nonetheless “pellucidly clear” that the court was obliged to uphold congressional authority.
In that same speech, he reflected on his majority opinion in the 2004-5 term’s most controversial case, upholding a city’s power to use eminent domain to condemn a private home and use the property for economic development.
He said that while his position in the case, Kelo v.
City of New London, was correct as a matter of constitutional interpretation, it was “entirely divorced from my judgment concerning the wisdom” of the city’s land-use policy.
In 1997 he wrote the court’s opinion in Clinton v.
Jones, rejecting President Bill Clinton’s request to delay proceedings in a sexual harassment suit brought by a former Arkansas state employee, Paula Corbin Jones.
Ms. Jones “has a right to an orderly disposition of her claims,” Justice Stevens wrote.
His patriotism was of the old-fashioned, unabashed variety.
In 1989, he dissented from the court’s decision that gave First Amendment protection to those who burn an American flag as a political protest.
“Sanctioning the public desecration of the flag will tarnish its value,” he wrote in that case, Texas v.
Johnson, “both for those who cherish the ideas for which it waves and for those who desire to don the robes of martyrdom by burning it.
” Reflecting years later on his vote in that case, Justice Stevens said that while he still believed he was right, he now saw a silver lining.
Flag burning had all but disappeared, he observed to a Chicago audience in 2006.
“What once was a courageous act of defiant expression is now perfectly lawful,” he noted, “and therefore is not worth the effort.
” Justice Stevens had various health problems over the years, including open-heart surgery to repair a valve in 1974, prostate cancer in 1992 and a blocked coronary artery that was cleared by inserting a stent in 1997.
But his energy and athleticism in advanced age continued to amaze those who witnessed it.
He remained an avid tennis player and golfer, shooting a hole in one in his 80s.
He was a bronze-level life master at bridge, which he and his wife played competitively.
They lived much of the year in an apartment in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
, with the justice traveling to Washington for court sessions and communicating with his law clerks and colleagues by email the rest of the time.
In retirement he wrote frequently, particularly for The New York Review of Books, and in 2011 he published a memoir, “Five Chiefs.
” In 2014 he published “Six Amendments: How and Why We Should Change the Constitution.
” In that book he proposed constitutional amendments that would unambiguously define the federal government’s power to, among other things, regulate firearms, limit campaign contributions, ban capital punishment and prohibit election-district gerrymandering to give one party an advantage.
Earlier this year, he published “The Making of a Justice: My First 94 Years.
” He also made forays into public debates.
In 2018 he wrote an opinion piece, after a school shooting, calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment.
Later that year he declared in a speech that Judge Brett Kavanaugh was unqualified for the Supreme Court because of his partisan language during a Senate hearing on his fitness for the court over an accusation he sexually assaulted a girl during high school.
Justice Stevens was known around the court for treating others with sensitivity and respect.
One former law clerk, Christopher L. Eisgruber, described in a 1993 essay an incident at a party for new clerks: Before Justice Stevens arrived, an older male justice had instructed one of the few female clerks present to serve coffee.
When Justice Stevens entered, he quickly grasped the situation, walked up to the young woman and said: “Thank you for taking your turn with the coffee.
I think it’s my turn now.
” He took over the job.
","John Paul Stevens, whose 35 years on the United States Supreme Court transformed him, improbably, from a Republican antitrust lawyer to the outspoken leader of the court’s liberal wing, died Tuesday at a hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
He was
99. The cause was complications from a stroke he suffered the day before, the Supreme Court announced in a statement.
When he retired in 2010 at the age of 90, Justice Stevens was the second-oldest and the second-longest-serving justice ever to sit on the court.
Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. was about eight months older when he retired in 1932, and William O. Douglas had served 36 years (1939-75).
Justice Stevens had spent much of his service on the court in the shadow of more readily definable colleagues when he emerged as a central figure during a crucial period of the court’s history: The last phase of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist’s tenure and the early years under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.
It was a time when the court took an active role in balancing individual liberty and national security and in policing the constitutional separation of powers, asserting a muscular brand of judicial authority that was welcomed by neither the White House nor Congress.
Societal debates over the rights of gay men and lesbians, the role of race, private property rights, environmental regulation and the separation of church and state also made their way onto the Supreme Court’s docket, and Justice Stevens, a low-key Republican from Chicago, was as surprised as anyone to find himself not only taking the liberal side but also becoming its ardent champion.
It was Justice Stevens who wrote the court’s majority opinion in Rasul v.
Bush, in 2004, which brought within the jurisdiction of the federal courts the hundreds of prisoners who had been captured as enemy combatants during the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan and held at the United States Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.
It was Justice Stevens who wrote the majority opinion in Hamdan v.
Rumsfeld, in 2006, which repudiated the Bush administration’s plan to put some of those detainees on trial by military commissions.
“The Executive is bound to comply with the Rule of Law that prevails in this jurisdiction,” he declared.
On the domestic side, in 2002, it was Justice Stevens who wrote the opinion in Atkins v.
Virginia, declaring that the Constitution does not permit executing the mentally disabled.
Such defendants “face a special risk of wrongful execution,” he said, because of their limited ability to understand their actions and participate in their own defense.
Justice Antonin Scalia’s dissenting opinion in that case provided an example of how deeply divided the court was during those years on both methodology and outcomes.
He complained that the 6-to-3 majority had simply enshrined its own views as constitutional law.
“The arrogance of this assumption of power takes one’s breath away,” Justice Scalia wrote.
Two years before that, Justice Stevens had his own turn at a bitter dissent, in Bush v.
Gore, the case that effectively decided the 2000 presidential election by stopping the Florida recount.
Justice Stevens, one of four dissenters, said the court’s action “can only lend credence to the most cynical appraisal of the work of judges throughout the land.
” He said that although the actual winner of the presidential election might remain unknown, “the identity of the loser is perfectly clear”: It was “the nation’s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.
” As the senior associate justice, with the power to assign majority opinions whenever he was in the majority and the chief justice was in dissent, Justice Stevens was the field marshal for a series of decisions that achieved liberal victories late in Chief Justice Rehnquist’s tenure.
He assigned opinions to others in favor of gay rights and affirmative action and kept for himself decisions that upheld the authority of the federal government in the face of what had appeared to be the unstoppable states’-rights tilt of the Rehnquist court’s federalism revolution.
Until this final period, Justice Stevens had been known to the public, if at all, primarily for the jaunty bow ties he usually wore.
His reputation was that of a very smart, nonideological, slightly quirky loner who, if a case was decided by a vote of 8 to 1, was as likely as not to be the solitary dissenter, caring neither to lead nor to follow.
He became the senior associate justice in his 19th year on the court, upon the retirement of Justice Harry A. Blackmun in 1994.
The role, which he appeared to enjoy, heightened his visibility and showed the world what his colleagues already knew: that he was actually a strategic thinker and canny tactician whose genial personality and impressive analytic power could forge a path that might have appeared blocked by the sheer arithmetic of a majority that was well to his right.
His frequent dissenting opinions, he said, arose from a conviction that both the public and the law were best served when differing views were expressed and explained, rather than suppressed for the sake of surface collegiality.
The court’s ideological spectrum was quite different when John Paul Stevens arrived from the federal appeals court in Chicago in December 1975, named by President Gerald R. Ford to replace Justice Douglas, who had retired a month earlier.
The liberal titans William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall were still sitting.
So was Lewis F. Powell Jr., an appointee of President Richard M. Nixon, who voted with the conservatives on criminal law issues but stoutly defended abortion rights.
Another colleague was Potter Stewart, the last of President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s four Supreme Court appointees and, like Justice Stevens, a moderate Republican from the Midwest.
Only five years apart in age despite Justice Stewart’s substantial seniority, the two men bonded.
In a speech in 2004, Justice Stevens said that Justice Stewart, who retired in 1981 and died four years later, “probably had the keenest intellect of any judge with whom I have served.
” The court’s membership turned over completely and moved indisputably to the right during Justice Stevens’s long tenure on the bench.
The extent to which it bridged two eras of Supreme Court history was underscored on Oct. 3, 2005, when he administered the oath of office to Chief Justice Roberts, a man 35 years his junior whom he had first met 25 years earlier, when Justice Stevens was the court’s most junior member and John Roberts was a law clerk.
But the emergence of John Paul Stevens as the court’s most liberal justice was not simply a result of standing still amid a shifting landscape.
His own views changed over time, moving to the left, particularly on the death penalty and on questions of racially conscious government policies.
He was skeptical of such policies at first, voting with the conservatives in the 1978 Bakke case to invalidate an admissions program at a University of California medical school that had set aside 16 places for minority applicants out of an entering class of 100.
The court ordered the medical school to admit Allan Bakke, the white applicant who had brought the case.
Two years later, when the Supreme Court upheld a set-aside program that reserved 10 percent of federal public works money for minority contractors, Justice Stevens was one of three dissenters, along with Justices Stewart and Rehnquist.
In his dissenting opinion in that case, Fullilove v.
Klutznick, he warned that the “slapdash statute,” as he described it, could become “a permanent source of justification for grants of special privileges.
” In 1989, he voted with the 6-to-3 majority that invalidated a 30 percent minority contracting set-aside program in the city of Richmond, Va.
Justices Marshall, Brennan and Blackmun dissented, with Justice Blackmun commenting, “I never thought that I would live to see the day” when the former “cradle of the Old Confederacy” would adopt a plan to help its African-American residents overcome a legacy of discrimination, only to see the effort struck down by “this court, the supposed bastion of equality.
” Nonetheless, Justice Stevens’s nuanced separate opinion in that case, Richmond v.
J.A.
Croson Company, demonstrated that he had begun to distance himself from the court’s increasingly conservative center of gravity.
He agreed that the Richmond ordinance had painted with too broad a brush.
But he did not agree with the majority’s premise that “a racial classification is never permissible except as a remedy for a past wrong”;
sometimes such a classification is permissible, he said, if it takes account of race as a policy tool for building a better future.
He had said as much in a dissenting opinion in 1986 in a case challenging a collective bargaining agreement that shielded African-American teachers against layoffs in a Michigan public school district.
The agreement was meant to preserve a hard-won racial balance in an economically troubled district, where the recently hired minority teachers would have been most vulnerable to seniority-based layoffs.
The 5-to-4 majority in that case, Wygant v.
Jackson Board of Education, concluded that the policy violated the white teachers’ 14th Amendment right to equal protection.
Justice Powell explained that there was no proof of past discrimination for which the policy could be justified as an appropriate remedy.
In dissent, Justice Stevens said the majority’s mistake was to look backward rather than forward.
Rather than ask whether the policy could be justified “as a remedy for sins that were committed in the past,” he said, “I believe that we should first ask whether the board’s action advances the public interest in educating children for the future.
” In a speech in 2004, Justice Stevens reflected on the “especially close” relationship he had enjoyed with Justice Powell, despite their differences in the Wygant case.
He recalled that as the case was about to be argued, it came up in casual conversation between them.
“We both remarked on the fact that our next affirmative action argument was in an ‘easy case,’” Justice Stevens said.
“It was only later that we both learned that we thought it easy for opposite reasons.
” His views on the death penalty similarly evolved.
He arrived at the Supreme Court in the aftermath of the 1972 Furman v.
Georgia decision, which invalidated every death penalty statute in the country.
The urgent question was whether a new generation of statutes that most states had enacted in response to the Furman ruling would now meet the court’s approval.
In 1976, in Gregg v.
Georgia, the newly appointed Justice Stevens voted with the 7-to-2 majority to endorse the new approach, which required special procedures to “channel” the jury’s discretion and to allow the resumption of capital punishment.
With the passing years, however, Justice Stevens began to express deep concerns about how the death penalty was being administered.
Recent evidence that “a substantial number of death sentences have been imposed erroneously” was “profoundly significant,” he told the American Bar Association in 2005, “because it indicates that there must be serious flaws in our administration of criminal justice.
” Finally, in 2008, he renounced capital punishment expressly, declaring that the time had come to reconsider “the justification for the death penalty itself.
” Too often, he said, court decisions and actions taken by states to justify the death penalty were “the product of habit and inattention rather than an acceptable deliberative process.
” The case was Baze v.
Rees, a constitutional challenge to Kentucky’s method of execution by lethal injection.
A majority rejected the challenge, and Justice Stevens concurred in that result, writing that he felt bound to “respect precedents that remain a part of our law.
” But he had made himself clear: in the court’s hands the death penalty had become, for him, a promise of fairness unfulfilled.
One plausible explanation for Justice Stevens’s growing affinity for the liberal side was his response to the polarizing discourse about the Supreme Court that emanated from the administration of President Ronald Reagan in the mid-1980s.
After Attorney General Edwin Meese III criticized a long series of Supreme Court precedents that had interpreted the Bill of Rights as binding not only on the federal government but on the states as well — a foundational premise of 20th-century constitutional law — Justice Stevens took him on directly.
The attorney general, he said in a speech to the Federal Bar Association in Chicago in 1985, “overlooks the profound importance of the Civil War and the postwar amendments on the structure of our government.
” Justice Stevens’s own explanation for why his views had changed was simply that he had learned on the job.
“I know that I, like most of my colleagues, have continued to participate in a learning process while serving on the bench,” he said in 2005 at a symposium held at Fordham University Law School to mark his 30th anniversary on the court and 35th year as a judge.
“Learning on the job is essential to the process of judging,” he continued.
“At the very least, I know that learning on the bench has been one of the most important and rewarding aspects of my own experience over the last 35 years.
” Yet in another sense he did not change very much, remaining what he had been at the start of his judicial career: a judge who looked at the facts on the ground rather than theories in law review articles, one who tended to regard doctrinal debates as a distraction from a judge’s real work, which in his opinion was the application of judgment to the case at hand.
His distinctive approach to the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection was perhaps the best example of his disdain for doctrinal formalism.
By the mid-1970s, the court had developed an elaborate grid for evaluating claims of unequal treatment at the hands of the government.
Policies that distinguished among people based on their race were subject to “strict” judicial scrutiny and were almost never upheld.
Policies that simply concerned economic interests were subject to minimal scrutiny and were upheld as long as they had a “rational basis.
” Policies that treated men and women differently fell somewhere in between, subject to “heightened” judicial scrutiny and required to serve an “important governmental interest.
” Justice Stevens rejected all this.
“There is only one Equal Protection Clause,” he declared in 1976, concurring in Craig v.
Boren, an early sex discrimination case.
“It requires every state to govern impartially.
” A straightforward application of that principle was all a court needed, in his view, to decide an equal protection case.
One of Justice Stevens’s former clerks, Andrew M. Siegel, a law professor at the University of South Carolina, summed up the justice’s jurisprudence in a paper delivered at the 2005 Fordham symposium.
“Perhaps the defining vision of Justice Stevens’s jurisprudence, indeed of his entire life project,” Professor Siegel wrote, “has been an unshakable faith in the capacity of men and women of the law to resolve difficult and contentious issues through the application of reason tempered by experience and humility.
” Professor William D. Popkin of the Indiana University School of Law wrote in a 1989 article in The Duke Law Journal that “a special brand of judicial restraint and creativity” marked Justice Stevens’s approach to the law.
Justice Stevens was guided by three principles, Professor Popkin wrote: first, “deference to other decision makers,” based on the view that “the court should not decide cases that other institutions can decide at least as well or better”;
second, attention to the facts of a case and avoidance of broad generalizations, based on the view that “the court should decide no more than the facts of the case require”;
and third, the belief that the court’s highest substantive goal was to “protect individual dignity,” as reflected in his approach to equal protection.
Justice Stevens gave concrete application to his view of a limited role for the courts in one of his most important majority opinions, the 1984 case Chevron v.
Natural Resources Defense Council.
The court held that when a federal statute is ambiguous, judges should generally defer to the interpretation of the agency charged with administering that statute rather than impose their own views of what Congress must have or should have meant.
“Federal judges — who have no constituency — have a duty to respect legitimate policy choices made by those who do,” Justice Stevens wrote.
Although the case remained obscure to the general public, it was a landmark of administrative law, and the term “Chevron deference” became commonplace in judicial decisions reviewing a seemingly endless array of federal regulations.
For the rest of his career, Justice Stevens looked back on the Chevron case with fondness and pride.
But while believing that judicial deference was often appropriate, he also believed that the federal courts must be available when other institutions of government failed to do their jobs.
“I firmly believe that the Framers of the Constitution expected and intended the vast open spaces in our charter of government to be filled not only by legislative enactment but also by the common-law process of step-by-step adjudication,” he said in a 1991 speech at the University of Chicago.
That university was his alma mater, and his family had deep roots in Chicago.
John Paul Stevens was born there on April 20, 1920, and grew up in a Georgian-style house in the Hyde Park neighborhood.
He was the fourth son and youngest child of Ernest James Stevens, a wealthy businessman with interests in real estate and insurance, and the former Elizabeth Street, an English teacher.
In 1909 his grandfather James W. Stevens, an ambitious and successful financier, had built what was then Chicago’s biggest hotel, the LaSalle.
His appetite whetted, the older Stevens then formed the family-owned Stevens Hotel Company to build and operate the world’s biggest hotel, a blocklong, 28-story, 3,000-room behemoth on Michigan Avenue that opened in 1927 as the Stevens Hotel.
Charles Lindbergh and Amelia Earhart were among the many celebrities the young John Paul Stevens met there.
Those early encounters may have inspired him;
he became an avid pilot himself, flying his single-engine Cessna 172 around the Midwest for many years.
The Depression ended his grandfather’s dream in a disastrous way.
Not only did the family lose the hotel, which was eventually bought by Conrad Hilton and stands today as the Hilton Chicago, but John’s grandfather, father and uncle were indicted by a Cook County grand jury on charges of looting the family’s insurance business in a failed effort to keep the hotel afloat.
Facing extreme stress, his grandfather had a severe stroke, while his uncle, Raymond Stevens, fell into a depression and committed suicide.
Only Justice Stevens’s father went to trial, and he was convicted in 1933 of embezzling $1.3 million.
The conviction was overturned the next year by the Illinois Supreme Court, which decided that Ernest Stevens’s actions had not amounted to a crime;
he had used bad judgment, the court said, but had acted in good faith in trying to save the hotel, without intending either to commit fraud or to enrich himself.
With his father making a modest living managing a hotel for someone else, John attended the University of Chicago, where he majored in English and edited the newspaper.
He graduated in 1941 as a member of Phi Beta Kappa and winner of the university’s highest honors for scholarship and student activities.
He was commissioned as an officer in the Navy on Dec. 6, 1941, the day before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
He spent most of his Navy service, which lasted until 1945, stationed at Pearl Harbor working on breaking Japanese codes, for which he was awarded the Bronze Star.
In 1942 he married Elizabeth Jane Sheeren, with whom he had a son and three daughters.
The couple divorced in 1979, and Justice Stevens married Maryan Mulholland Simon, a dietitian, the next year.
She died in 2015.
His son, John Joseph, died of cancer in 1996, and his daughter Kathryn preceded him in death.
He is survived by two daughters, Elizabeth Jane Sesemann and Susan Roberta Mullen, nine grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.
With two older brothers who were lawyers, John was encouraged after his discharge from the Navy to attend law school himself.
He used the G.I.
Bill to attend Northwestern University Law School, where he completed his degree in two years.
He was editor in chief of the law review and graduated first in the class of 1947 with the highest grade-point average in the school’s history.
A Supreme Court clerkship was a natural sequel.
He spent the court’s 1947-48 term as a law clerk to Justice Wiley B. Rutledge, a respected former law professor and dean who was President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s last Supreme Court appointee.
Justice Rutledge, who died of a stroke at 55 in 1949, cutting short his service on the court after six years, influenced his young protégé profoundly.
Justice Rutledge viewed himself as an old-fashioned “common law” judge who decided cases one at a time.
He was a liberal and, while committed to a strong national government, was also an internationalist;
in 1948 he dissented on behalf of a group of German-born United States residents challenging the government’s right to deport them.
Justice Rutledge had “great faith in wisdom born of experience and mistrusted untried statements of general principles,” Mr. Stevens wrote in an admiring essay in the mid-1950s, years before his own judicial career began.
Decades later, in writing the court’s opinion that gave the Guantánamo detainees access to federal court, Justice Stevens took great pleasure in vindicating his old boss’s position in the 1948 case, Ahrens v.
Clark.
And in rejecting the Bush administration’s plan for military commissions, Justice Stevens cited another dissent by Justice Rutledge, from 1946, in which he argued on behalf of habeas corpus for a Japanese general, Tomoyuki Yamashita, who had been sentenced to death by a military commission.
After his Supreme Court clerkship, Mr. Stevens returned to Chicago to begin what would be a 22-year career in private practice.
Although he had always been known simply as John Stevens, he began adding his middle name when signing legal pleadings to add something extra to his bland first and last names.
The full name eventually became part of his professional identity.
He handled regulatory and antitrust cases at one of the city’s most prominent firms, Poppenhusen, Johnston, Thompson &
Raymond, now known as Jenner &
Block.
After three years there, he and two other junior associates left to start their own firm, Rothschild, Stevens, Barry &
Myers.
He remained there until 1970, when Senator Charles H. Percy, an Illinois Republican who had been a University of Chicago classmate, proposed that the Nixon administration nominate him for a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the federal appeals court based in Chicago.
He was a reluctant nominee, at first urging Senator Percy to ask him again in six years.
“I told John,” Mr. Percy later recalled, “if you wait six years, I may not be senator and there may not be a Republican president.
And in that time you could be on the Supreme Court.
” Mr. Stevens had become prominent in Chicago legal circles, if not among the public at large, for his role in a riveting political drama the previous year: an ethics scandal involving two members of the Illinois Supreme Court.
Chief Justice Roy J. Solfisburg and Justice Ray I. Klingbiel were accused by a private citizen of having accepted valuable bank stock from a politically influential Chicago lawyer in exchange for ruling in his favor in a criminal case.
The court set up a special commission to investigate the charge, with Mr. Stevens as its counsel.
He was selected not only because of his good reputation but also because, with a law practice that was based in federal court, he had no ties to the state court bench.
During an intense six-week period, working without compensation in the full glare of a news media spotlight, he organized and led the investigation and presented findings that validated the accusation and led to the resignation of the two justices.
Mr. Stevens won high praise for his efforts and said later that he learned invaluable lessons about how appellate courts work.
The episode became the subject of a book, “Illinois Justice,” by Kenneth A. Manaster, published by the University of Chicago Press in 2001.
Senator Percy proved to be a better prophet than his reluctant nominee could have imagined.
The retirement of Justice Douglas in November 1975 was a potential problem for President Ford, who was about to enter a challenging re-election campaign and did not want the Supreme Court to be a source of controversy.
He asked his attorney general, Edward H. Levi, to find a nominee who would win easy approval.
Mr. Levi, a former dean of the University of Chicago Law School and president of the university, knew Judge Stevens and recommended him highly.
The president acted quickly.
In two weeks the nomination was official, and 19 days later, on Dec. 17, 1975, Justice Stevens was confirmed by a vote of 98 to
0. The only opposition during his three-day confirmation hearing came from several women’s groups, which objected to his dissent from a ruling by the appeals court that it was illegal for an airline to require flight attendants to remain single.
Even though he was the first Supreme Court nominee since the court established the constitutional right to abortion in Roe v.
Wade, nearly three years earlier, he was not asked a single question about abortion during his confirmation hearing.
Thirty years later, on the occasion of Fordham Law School’s anniversary symposium, Ford sent a letter to the school’s dean, William Michael Treanor.
“I am prepared,” the former president wrote, “to allow history’s judgment of my term in office to rest (if necessary, exclusively) on my nomination 30 years ago of Justice John Paul Stevens to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
” Among the positions for which Justice Stevens was best known on the court was his insistence on strict separation of church and state.
“Whenever we remove a brick from the wall that was designed to separate religion and government, we increase the risk of religious strife and weaken the foundation of our democracy,” he wrote in dissent from a 2002 decision that upheld an Ohio program providing taxpayer-financed vouchers for religious school tuition.
In an abortion case in 1989, he was the only justice to take the position that a Missouri statute declaring that life begins at conception not only violated the court’s abortion precedents but also was impermissible as “an unequivocal endorsement of a religious tenet” that “serves no identifiable secular purpose.
” Over the years, he was a strong defender of the court’s precedents defining the right to abortion.
He was also strongly on the federal government’s side in the court’s running debate over the proper allocation of federal and state power.
He wrote the court’s 2005 opinion upholding the power of Congress to prohibit the use of marijuana for medical purposes in California and other states that had chosen to permit it.
Later that year, he told a bar meeting in Las Vegas that while he agreed with “the policy choice made by millions of California voters,” it was nonetheless “pellucidly clear” that the court was obliged to uphold congressional authority.
In that same speech, he reflected on his majority opinion in the 2004-5 term’s most controversial case, upholding a city’s power to use eminent domain to condemn a private home and use the property for economic development.
He said that while his position in the case, Kelo v.
City of New London, was correct as a matter of constitutional interpretation, it was “entirely divorced from my judgment concerning the wisdom” of the city’s land-use policy.
In 1997 he wrote the court’s opinion in Clinton v.
Jones, rejecting President Bill Clinton’s request to delay proceedings in a sexual harassment suit brought by a former Arkansas state employee, Paula Corbin Jones.
Ms. Jones “has a right to an orderly disposition of her claims,” Justice Stevens wrote.
His patriotism was of the old-fashioned, unabashed variety.
In 1989, he dissented from the court’s decision that gave First Amendment protection to those who burn an American flag as a political protest.
“Sanctioning the public desecration of the flag will tarnish its value,” he wrote in that case, Texas v.
Johnson, “both for those who cherish the ideas for which it waves and for those who desire to don the robes of martyrdom by burning it.
” Reflecting years later on his vote in that case, Justice Stevens said that while he still believed he was right, he now saw a silver lining.
Flag burning had all but disappeared, he observed to a Chicago audience in 2006.
“What once was a courageous act of defiant expression is now perfectly lawful,” he noted, “and therefore is not worth the effort.
” He wrote two particularly notable dissenting opinions toward the end of his career, both in 5-to-4 cases in which the conservative justices prevailed.
One was District of Columbia v.
Heller (2008), in which the court for the first time interpreted the Second Amendment as protecting an individual right to own a gun.
The other was Citizens United v.
Federal Election Commission, which freed corporations from federal limits on campaign spending.
The decision “threatens to undermine the integrity of elected institutions across the nation,” Justice Stevens wrote.
It was that decision in early 2010, in fact, that prompted his decision to retire.
Reading his dissenting opinion from the bench, he stumbled uncharacteristically over his words.
He had suffered a small stroke.
His retirement that spring opened a second vacancy for President Barack Obama to fill.
The president named Elena Kagan, then serving in the administration as solicitor general, to the seat.
Justice Stevens had various health problems over the years, including open-heart surgery to repair a valve in 1974, prostate cancer in 1992 and a blocked coronary artery that was cleared by inserting a stent in 1997.
But his energy and athleticism in advanced age continued to amaze those who witnessed it.
He remained an avid tennis player and golfer, shooting a hole in one in his 80s.
He was a bronze-level life master at bridge, which he and his wife played competitively.
They lived much of the year in an apartment in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
, with the justice traveling to Washington for court sessions and communicating with his law clerks and colleagues by email the rest of the time.
In retirement he wrote frequently, particularly for The New York Review of Books, and in 2011 he published a memoir, “Five Chiefs.
” In 2014 he published “Six Amendments: How and Why We Should Change the Constitution.
” In that book he proposed constitutional amendments that would unambiguously define the federal government’s power to, among other things, regulate firearms, limit campaign contributions, ban capital punishment and prohibit election-district gerrymandering to give one party an advantage.
This year, he published “The Making of a Justice: Reflections on My First 94 Years.
” In an interview last November, Justice Stevens said that he first thought of writing the book during a surprise 94th birthday party.
By the time he finished writing, the book had grown to 531 pages.
“It’s a long story,” Justice Stevens explained.
He also made forays into public debates.
In 2018 he wrote an opinion piece, after a school shooting, calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment.
Later that year he declared in a speech that Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh was unqualified for the Supreme Court because of his partisan language during a Senate hearing on his fitness for the court over an accusation he sexually assaulted a girl during high school.
Justice Stevens was known around the court for treating others with sensitivity and respect.
One former law clerk, Christopher L. Eisgruber, described in a 1993 essay an incident at a party for new clerks: Before Justice Stevens arrived, an older male justice had instructed one of the few female clerks present to serve coffee.
When Justice Stevens entered, he quickly grasped the situation, walked up to the young woman and said: “Thank you for taking your turn with the coffee.
I think it’s my turn now.
” He took over the job.

86,1724172,"['surpass 5000', '5000 mark', 'years later', '']","Carol Channing, whose incandescent performances as the gold-digging Lorelei Lee in “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes” and the matchmaker Dolly Gallagher Levi in “Hello, Dolly!” made her a Broadway legend, died early Tuesday at her home in Rancho Mirage, Calif.
She was
97. Her death was confirmed by her publicist, B. Harlan Boll, who said she had two strokes in the past year.
Ms. Channing was bringing audiences to their feet night after night in a revival of “Hello, Dolly!” when she was 74 — appearing at the top of the staircase singing, “Wow, wow, wow, fellas, / Look at the old girl now, fellas,” resplendent in her scarlet gown and jewels, her platinum hair crowned with red plumage.
Ten years later she was still getting applause, this time for a cabaret act.
Nine years after that, just a few days before her 93rd birthday, she appeared at Town Hall in Manhattan as part of a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the night “Dolly” opened.
“Performing is the only excuse for my existence,” she said during her last Broadway appearance, in the 1995 revival of “Hello, Dolly!” “What can be better than this?” Ms. Channing was one of the most recognizable presences in the theater world.
Her tousled hairdo, headlight-size eyes and exaggerated mouth were the subject of countless caricatures.
For many years her real hair, damaged by bleaching, was covered by a wig.
Her false eyelashes, worn at a fantastic length since she was a teenager, posed a more serious problem.
The glue that was used to attach them gradually pulled out her natural lashes, and Ms. Channing began painting on the long spikes.
By then her vision had become impaired, but she was philosophical about her somewhat hazy view of her fellow actors.
“I know what they look like,” she said.
The generous mouth was put to amazing use in “Hello, Dolly!” In one scene she shoveled into it, with assembly-line speed, one potato puff after another.
The stage puffs, made from Kleenex and tinted with powdered Sanka, were spit out into a napkin when the audience’s attention was directed elsewhere.
As Ms. Channing told the story, her mouth held 22 puffs with ease, and 27 with no great difficulty;
her standby could manage only three.
Ms. Channing’s voice, gravel-toned and capable of sinking to subterranean levels, was as distinctive as her appearance.
When she sang a song in her exaggerated growl, it belonged to her forever;
only Louis Armstrong’s own growling rendition of “Hello, Dolly!” was a match for hers.
Her speech in public, described as everything from a “raspy yawp” to a foghorn, was deceptive, friends said: When alone with them, she was perfectly capable of less stylized enunciation and enjoyed serious conversation.
The critic Walter Kerr called her “maybe the only creature extant who can live up to a Hirschfeld,” explaining that the theatrical caricaturist Al Hirschfeld “always lives up to the people he draws, but the people he draws don’t always live up to him.
” Mr. Kerr added, “Here’s the exception: mascara to swim in, nobly tragic mouth, the face of a great mystic about to make a terrible mistake.
” The tall, flamboyant Ms. Channing became a Broadway star at the Ziegfeld Theater on Dec. 8, 1949.
That was the opening night of “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,” a musical based on Anita Loos’s best seller of the 1920s, with music by Jule Styne, lyrics by Leo Robin and choreography by Agnes de Mille.
Ms. Channing starred as the flapper Lorelei Lee, and her stardom was assured when she sang Lorelei’s anthem, “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend”: Time rolls on And youth is gone And you can’t straighten up when you bend.
But stiff back or stiff knees, You stand straight at Tiff‘ny’s, Diamonds are a girl’s best friend.
Time magazine summed up her performance: “Perhaps once in a decade a nova explodes above the Great White Way with enough brilliance to reillumine the whole gaudy legend of show business.
” Brooks Atkinson, the drama critic of The New York Times, hailed her Lorelei Lee as “the most fabulous comic creation of this dreary period in history.
” The show ran almost two years on Broadway, and Ms. Channing played Lorelei on tour for another year.
In the next decade, she appeared on Broadway in “Wonderful Town,” “The Vamp” and “Show Girl.
” She also created a nightclub act that toured the country.
The producer David Merrick, who had acquired the Broadway rights to Thornton Wilder’s play “The Matchmaker” and was in the process of turning it into the musical “Hello, Dolly!,” caught Ms. Channing’s act in Minneapolis and discussed the role of Dolly Gallagher Levi with her.
She later met with Gower Champion, who had been enlisted as director and choreographer — and who, with his wife, Marge, had played an important role in Ms. Channing’s early career — and the role was hers.
“Hello, Dolly!,” with a score by Jerry Herman, opened at the St. James Theater on Jan. 16, 1964, and received ecstatic reviews.
It went on to win 10 Tony Awards, including one for Ms. Channing as best actress in a musical.
Among those she beat out was Barbra Streisand, who was nominated for “Funny Girl.
” To Ms. Channing’s disappointment, however, it was Ms. Streisand who was chosen to star in the 1969 film version of “Hello, Dolly!,” which meant that both of Ms. Channing’s signature roles ended up being played onscreen by other actresses: Marilyn Monroe had played Lorelei Lee in the movie version of “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.
” Ms. Channing’s own motion picture career never really took off, although she received an Academy Award nomination and won a Golden Globe for her performance in “Thoroughly Modern Millie” (1967).
She did enjoy some success on television, and in her later years she did a lot of cartoon voice-over work.
But the theater was her natural home.
“Hello, Dolly!” ran for almost seven years on Broadway.
Ginger Rogers assumed the title role when Ms. Channing left to take the show on the road in the summer of 1965, and Pearl Bailey, Ethel Merman and other marquee names later played it as well.
(Bette Midler and Bernadette Peters starred in a hit Broadway revival that began in 2017.) But ultimately the part belonged to Ms. Channing, who toured with revivals in 1977, 1982 and 1994.
By the time she returned to the role on Broadway in October 1995, Ms. Channing had played Dolly more than 4,500 times, missing only one performance — in June of that year, when she left the show for a day to fly to New York from San Diego to accept a Tony Award for lifetime achievement.
She had appeared onstage in a cast, a neck brace and a wheelchair, and with viruses that would have felled anyone with lesser determination.
She toured 30 cities with that production before opening on Broadway, where “Dolly” played to packed houses for 15 weeks before moving on to Britain, Australia, Japan and China.
Between the “Dolly” revivals, Ms. Channing starred in tours of “Jerry’s Girls,” a musical revue built around Mr. Herman’s songs, and, with Mary Martin, in the James Kirkwood comedy “Legends.
” In 1974 she appeared on Broadway in “Lorelei,” a revised version of “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.
” Carol Elaine Channing was born in Seattle on Jan. 31, 1921, and grew up in San Francisco, the only child of George and Adelaide (Glaser) Channing.
She later recalled that she was both frightened and embarrassed by her mother, a woman of wildly varying moods who kept her from having friends and lied to her teachers about her.
But Carol adored her father, a newspaperman turned Christian Science lecturer.
In her 2002 autobiography, “Just Lucky I Guess,” Ms. Channing revealed that when she was 16 her mother told her that her father was part black;
she kept her racial heritage a secret, she wrote, for fear that it would be bad for her career.
She discovered early that she had a talent to entertain.
At the age of 7 she ran for secretary of her class, and when she couldn’t think of a good reason to ask her classmates to vote for her, she began doing imitations of her teachers rather than making a speech.
She was hooked from the moment she heard the first wave of laughter.
She also won the election.
She studied drama and dance at Bennington College in Vermont.
During the summer of 1940 she worked briefly at the Tamiment Playhouse, the famed incubator of talent in the Poconos, but failed to make much of an impression on Max Liebman, the playhouse’s director.
(He was later the creator of “Your Show of Shows,” the TV show that made Sid Caesar a star.
) The next winter, during a recess at Bennington, she went to New York to try her luck and was cast in Marc Blitzstein’s opera “No for an Answer.
” The show folded after three days, but Ms. Channing, encouraged by the one line of praise she received in The New Yorker, decided to seek work on Broadway.
In October 1941 she became an understudy to Eve Arden in the Cole Porter musical “Let’s Face It,” but the next year, after having replaced Ms. Arden only once, she accepted a pay cut to $50 a week from $65 to appear in a play about nurses on Bataan, “Proof Through the Night.
” It lasted a week.
After sporadic work in nightclubs and at Catskills resorts, she returned to San Francisco at her father’s insistence in 1946.
The next year she persuaded him to give her one last crack at the theater.
She ventured to Los Angeles, where she did one-nighters and benefits before obtaining an audition with Marge Champion, who was looking for new faces for “Lend an Ear,” a satirical revue for which Ms. Champion’s husband staged the musical numbers.
“She certainly was awkward and odd-looking,” Ms. Champion remembered years later, “but her warmth and her wholesomeness came through to me.
” With Ms. Channing in the cast, “Lend an Ear” played for five months in Los Angeles before opening on Broadway in December 1948.
It ran for just over a year, and Anita Loos and the producers Herman Levin and Oliver Smith remembered Ms. Channing’s performance when they set out to cast Lorelei Lee in “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.
” Ms. Channing maintained that “we have no such thing as age.
” She said she did not observe her birthday until Jan. 31, 1993, her 72nd, when she was a guest at a White House dinner and, to her amazement, President Bill Clinton noted the occasion in his remarks.
When she replied that she had never celebrated her birthday, the president responded, “Well, then this is your first birthday.
” She did, however, resent the change in attitude prompted by advancing years.
“I sometimes get the strangest treatment from people,” she told The Times in 1995.
“They try to force you to be what they think you are.
They think you’re somebody you’re not.
They start worrying about you and looking at you differently and helping you across the street.
” She was then in her mid-70s but believed, she said, that she had not yet peaked.
“Shirley Temple peaked at 7,” she said.
“I haven’t gotten myself together yet.
” She remained active well into her 80s.
Reviewing her performance at Feinstein’s at the Regency in 2005, Stephen Holden of The Times wrote: “Although substantially diminished in power, Ms. Channing’s blend of unbridled optimism and ferocious vitality is still a primal show business force field.
At 84, she personifies the adult child as natural show-off and clown, brimming with curiosity and humor, accentuating the positive.
” In 2012 Ms. Channing was the subject of a documentary, “Carol Channing: Larger Than Life,” directly by Dori Berinstein.
Her first two marriages, to Theodore Naidish, a writer, and Alexander Carson, a professional football player, ended in divorce.
She had a son, Channing, by her second husband;
he was later adopted by her third husband, the television producer Charles Lowe, and as Chan Lowe her son was for many years the editorial cartoonist for The Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
Ms. Channing and Mr. Lowe were married in 1956 and were for many years a partnership, with Mr. Lowe negotiating Ms. Channing’s contracts and dealing with every detail of her career.
That partnership unraveled in 1998, when they separated after she had accused him of mismanagement.
They were estranged at the time of Mr. Lowe’s death in 1999.
In 2003 Ms. Channing married Harry Kullijian, who had been her junior high school sweetheart.
He died in December 2011.
She is survived by her son.
Ms. Channing’s reputation as a highly individual personality was enhanced by her food habits.
For many years she carried organically grown food in silver containers to restaurants, dinner parties and even the White House.
The food was prepared with bottled water because, she said, she was allergic to something in tap water.
It turned out that her food allergies were traceable to the hair dye she used.
When she stopped dyeing her hair and began to wear wigs offstage as well as on, the sensitivity to tap water eased.
Ms. Channing once said that she hoped to die like David Burns, her original co-star in “Hello, Dolly!,” who got a big laugh in 1971 in a tryout of the musical “70 Girls 70” in Philadelphia and then keeled over onstage while the laugh continued.
“The audience didn’t know there was anything wrong, you see,” she said.
“He died hearing the laugh build.
I can’t think of a better way to go.

That same year she sang a rewritten, politically partisan version of the title song, called “Hello, Lyndon!,” which President Lyndon B. Johnson, running for a full four-year term, played at campaign stops.
She went on to perform the song, accompanied by Mr. Herman on the piano, in a show staged during the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City.
Ms. Channing and the Johnson family became close friends, and there was some speculation years later that that relationship had landed her on President Richard M. Nixon’s infamous enemies list.

] The goal of Elon Musk, the founder and chief executive of SpaceX, is to send people to space.
But how can he possibly pay for such an expensive venture?
SpaceX, for all its successes, is still a fairly small company, and the profit margin on rocket launches is small.
The solution may be to start an entirely different space business: satellites to provide high-speed internet everywhere.
The company’s next launch, will put into space the first pieces for a constellation called Starlink.
“This would provide connectivity to people who either don't have any connectivity today or where it's extremely expensive and unreliable,” Mr. Musk said during a Wednesday news conference.
The launch was postponed on Wednesday evening because of winds in the upper atmosphere.
The company said it will try again on Thursday evening.

Mr. Musk posted pictures of the Starlink satellites on Twitter.
The Starlink satellites will eventually form a constellation of satellites that are to offer internet to almost anywhere on Earth.
Last year, SpaceX launched two prototype satellites, called Tintin A and Tintin B. The payload on this launch, at more than 30,000 pounds, is the heaviest ever launched by SpaceX, Mr. Musk said.
He added that these satellites would be able to relay information by bouncing the data off a ground station.
However, they lack a component planned for future versions: lasers that would allow the satellites to relay information to each other.
Each of the flat-panel satellites weighs about 500 pounds, powered by a single solar array.
They are to be deployed about one hour after launch, steadily moving outward from a slowly spinning core.
“It will almost seem like spreading a deck of cards on a table,” Mr. Musk said.
The satellites are to be switched on two to three hours after deployment.
Mr. Musk sounded a note of caution to tamp down expectations.
“There is a lot of new technology here,” he said.
“It’s possible that some of these satellites may not work.
In fact, it’s possible, a small possibility, that all of the satellites may not work.
” A number of companies do satellite internet using geostationary communications satellites 22,200 miles above the surface.
At that altitude, the time for the satellite to complete an orbit is exactly one day and thus it remains over the exact same spot on Earth as the planet rotates at the same rate.
That makes it straightforward for one satellite to provide internet for a swath of the surface below, but current services have drawbacks.
They are not available everywhere and they are usually fairly expensive.
Because the data signals have to travel up 22,200 miles and then back down, the performance can be laggy.
That does not matter if you are watching a movie on Netflix, but it becomes excruciating when playing an online game that relies on fast reflexes.
The Starlink satellites will orbit much lower — between 210 and 710 miles above the surface.
That reduces the lagginess, or latency.
SpaceX has said performance should be comparable to ground-based cable and optical fiber networks that carry most internet traffic today.
Starlink would provide high-speed internet to parts of the world that currently are largely cut off from the modern digital world.
Because the satellites are lower, they travel faster.
Thus, Starlink must provide a constellation of satellites whizzing around the planet.
When one satellite moves away from one of its customers, another one must come into view in order to provide a continuous internet connection.
Mark Juncosa, vice president for vehicle engineering at SpaceX, said that with 12 additional launches, SpaceX could provide good coverage over the United States;
24 launches would put enough satellites to cover most populated areas;
and 30 would cover the entire world.
If Starlink is successful, more satellites would be added to send and receive greater volumes of data.
Starlink’s competitors include OneWeb, Telesat, Iridium and  Amazon.
For Mr. Musk’s dream of sending people to Mars, he is developing a giant spacecraft called Starship.
He noted that SpaceX’s rocket launching business might grow to about $3 billion a year.
By contrast, internet revenue could bring in $30 billion a year for the company, Mr. Musk said.
“We see this as a way for SpaceX to generate revenue that can be used to develop more and more advanced rockets and spaceships,” Mr. Musk said.
“We think this is a key steppingstone on the way to establishing a self-sustaining city on Mars and a base on the moon.
” Currently, there are about 2,000 operational satellites around Earth.
That number will multiply as constellations like Starlink are deployed.
“A majority of the satellites in orbit will be SpaceX, if things goes according to plan,” Mr. Musk said.
“That is a big if, of course.
” The worry is what happens when satellites die.
The proliferation of satellites will greatly increase the risks of collisions, and the many pieces of debris would in turn pose danger to other satellites.
Mr. Musk said each Starlink satellite would possess data on orbits on all known pieces of space debris and automatically steer away from any that might cross its path.
With so many satellites, there will also be much more debris falling from space in the coming years.
SpaceX said that 95 percent of a Starlink satellite would burn up on re-entry, but that would still mean that about 25 pounds of debris would reach the surface.
Mr. Musk said that discarded spacecraft would be aimed to the mostly empty Pacific Ocean and that the debris would come down in small pieces.
The chances of any one crashing satellite hurting or killing someone is small;
the danger to you in particular is negligible.
But adding up the risks of tens of thousands of satellites to the 7.5 billion people on Earth, the probability of someone being hurt somewhere becomes more significant.
","[Follow Thursday’s SpaceX launch here.
] The goal of Elon Musk, the founder and chief executive of SpaceX, is to send people to space.
But how can he possibly pay for such an expensive venture?
SpaceX, for all its successes, is still a fairly small company, and the profit margin on rocket launches is small.
The solution may be to start an entirely different space business: satellites to provide high-speed internet everywhere.
The company’s next launch, will put into space the first pieces for a constellation called Starlink.
“This would provide connectivity to people who either don't have any connectivity today or where it's extremely expensive and unreliable,” Mr. Musk said during a Wednesday news conference.

88,1811196,"['train station', 'hong kong', 'homemade laboratory', 'masked men', 'police officers', 'independent inquiry', '16-year-old']","HONG KONG — Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched across Hong Kong’s main island on Sunday to protest the city’s embattled government, occupying major thoroughfares in defiance of police orders and gathering outside the Chinese government’s liaison office in the city, a direct challenge to Beijing’s authority.
The demonstration on Sunday afternoon began as a peaceful march emphasizing the protesters’ demand for an independent investigation into what they said was police brutality in earlier street clashes.
At first, the turnout appeared lighter than that of Sunday marches in recent weeks.
But as the afternoon wore on, crowds swelled and thousands of demonstrators marched well past where the police had said the official march should end.
They occupied major roads, milling around outside government offices and the headquarters of the Hong Kong police.
By nightfall, protesters had gathered outside the Chinese liaison office and blocked a nearby road with barriers and road signs.
Some defaced a crest of the Chinese government on the building’s exterior with black ink.
And as riot police began to approach the crowd, another night of clashes between protesters and riot police officers seemed inevitable.
The developments on Sunday were the latest chapter in the city’s largest-ever demonstrations that have thrown it into the worst political crisis since China reclaimed sovereignty from Britain in 1997.
They also signaled growing antagonism between the largely peaceful protest movement and the front-line officers patrolling it.
A day earlier, the police said, officers raided an industrial building and seized about two pounds of powerful explosives, 10 gasoline bombs and nitric acid, as well as bullets, slingshots, knives and metal rods.
The police described the site as a “homemade laboratory” of triacetone triperoxide, a highly unstable explosive also known as TATP.
They said they were investigating whether the explosives were related to the Sunday protest but did not have adequate evidence to make conclusions.
Three men in their 20s were arrested in connection with the case.
Hong Kong’s mass demonstrations began in early June in response to unpopular legislation that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the courts are controlled by the governing Communist Party.
The bill has since been suspended but not fully withdrawn, one of the protesters’ key demands.
On Sunday, protesters dressed mostly in black T-shirts set off from Victoria Park in the Causeway Bay area of Hong Kong’s main island.
Some carried signs saying, “No extradition to China” and “Stop police brutality.
” “The government must withdraw the bill and set up an independent inquiry committee to investigate the police,” Tommy Tsang, an 81-year-old retiree, said at the protest on Sunday.
He said he was particularly angered by the police violence.
“If you don’t hit people, why would they hit you back?” he said.
Supporters of the push for an independent inquiry include members of the city’s pro-democracy legislative minority, the Hong Kong Bar Association and the European Parliament, which issued a statement on Thursday that called for an “independent and impartial investigation into the use of force by the Hong Kong police against the crowds.
” An open letter signed by a few hundred people who said they were relatives of police officers has also called for an independent inquiry.
But advisers to the territory’s embattled chief executive, Carrie Lam, said that her administration did not intend to make further concessions to the protesters.
That stance suggests the government is confident it can weather further protests despite signs that the unrest could damage the local economy and the risk that more protests could result in injuries or deaths among demonstrators or police officers.
Police officials say that they have largely acted with restraint and have used force only when attacked by protesters.
They accused some protesters of rioting during recent demonstrations, including one in which a small group forcefully stormed the Hong Kong legislature and spray-painted political slogans.
The police and a watchdog that monitors complaints against them have said they plan to investigate the tactics used against protesters at a June 12 demonstration that turned violent.
Many people in Hong Kong, a city of about seven million, say they believe that the police response that day — which included firing tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds — was excessive.
But the protesters and their supporters argue that the watchdog is not independent and will not conduct a fair investigation.
They also note that the Hong Kong government has commissioned past inquiries over civil unrest.
At the start of Sunday’s protests, the crowd spanned a diverse age range.
“Everyone is out here for their children,” said Sam Tam, 57, who attended marches this month with his 8-year-old daughter and about 18 relatives.
“The older generation has to say sorry to the younger generation for not listening to their voices,” he added.
But as the day dragged on, it was mainly those from the core demographic of the recent protests — young people in their 20s — who led the occupation of major roads and government offices.
Brian Heung, a student at Hong Kong University, said he and other protesters had intentionally disobeyed the police out of a sense of desperation over the government’s response to their demands.
“We have done everything peacefully, and they don’t have a proper response,” Mr. Heung, 18, said after putting up a Post-it note on a barricade outside Police Headquarters calling officers shameless.
“So we had to push the limits.
” Before the march, protest organizers had requested a police permit to march west from Victoria Park to the Court of Final Appeal, in the center of Hong Kong’s primary business district.
The police denied that request and said the march would have to officially end in the city’s Wan Chai district, just east of Admiralty, a district that houses the city’s legislature and other government offices.
But on Sunday afternoon, thousands of protesters at the front of the crowd defied those orders by streaming west into Admiralty, where the police had erected 6.5-foot plastic barriers outside parts of the government office complex.
Some of the protesters there approached a metal fence outside the complex and began heckling police officers in riot gear who were stationed inside.
Others gathered outside the Hong Kong Police Headquarters nearby, chanting, “Shame.
” By nightfall, some protesters had passed the Court of Final Appeal in Central Hong Kong and gathered outside the Chinese government’s liaison office in the city, which lies farther west on the island and where a crowd was already gathering.
By 8 p.m., riot police had gathered nearby, and the force warned in a post on Twitter that it would soon begin an operation to clear the crowd from west to east — the reverse direction of the protests — in the face “of the escalating violence.
” Minutes later, about 100 riot police officers, some carrying guns with plastic rounds, approached the liaison office and dragged away metal barricades that protesters had placed in the road.
“Charge forward!” they shouted, as hundreds of protesters fled east through the streets.
The protest on Sunday came a week after a rally urging Mrs.
Lam to resign and fully withdraw the extradition bill devolved into a frenzied brawl between a small group of protesters and officers in riot gear in a luxury shopping mall.
The protesters have also turned their anger at mainland Chinese who visit Hong Kong to shop or to buy medicine, powdered baby formula and other goods for resale across the border.
Last weekend, a demonstration in a Hong Kong border town against so-called parallel traders ended in clashes with the police.
Afterward, the Junior Police Officers’ Association, a union, called on the Police Department to safeguard the personal safety and “emotional well-being” of officers in the field.
That statement came days after Mrs.
Lam condemned last weekend’s street clashes and thanked the city’s police officers for “safeguarding Hong Kong’s safety at the front lines.
” Demonstrations in support of the police have also been organized by pro-establishment groups, including one on Saturday that organizers said drew more than 300,000 people.
The police put attendance at just over 100,000.
","HONG KONG — The Hong Kong police fired rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets on Sunday to disperse protesters after some of them vandalized the Chinese government’s liaison office in the city, a direct challenge to Beijing’s authority after a peaceful protest earlier in the day.
In a separate clash, footage from a local television station showed, masked men, dressed in white and wielding sticks, assaulted antigovernment protesters in a train station late Sunday night in northwestern Hong Kong.
The unrest spiraled out of a march that called for an independent investigation into what protesters said was police brutality in earlier street clashes.
The march was peaceful, but thousands of demonstrators later marched past where the police had said the official demonstration should end.
Protesters then occupied major roads and heckled police officers stationed outside government buildings.
“Recover Hong Kong;
it’s the time for revolution,” some chanted.
By nightfall, some protesters had defaced a crest of the Chinese government at the liaison office with eggs and black ink, and had sprayed the building’s exterior with graffiti.
Shortly after 8 p.m., about 100 riot police officers, some carrying guns with plastic rounds, approached the liaison office and dragged away metal barricades that protesters had placed in the road.
“Charge forward!” they shouted, as hundreds of protesters fled east through the streets.
Scuffles soon broke out nearby, with some protesters lobbing eggs and bags of liquid at the police during a standoff outside the Central Police Station.
After a group of protesters charged forward and threw projectiles, riot police officers rushed them, shooting several rounds of tear gas.
That same evening, at the Yuen Long train station, an unknown group of masked men in white attacked protesters and civilians, said Jerming Zhang, a 16-year-old student and first-aid volunteer who was at the station.
He said in a phone interview that as civilians, including those with children, tried to flee the station, the masked men followed them onto an open train and continued beating people with wooden sticks.
“It was like a stampede,” he said.
“They hit people indiscriminately, smiling as they beat them up.
” In a statement on Sunday night, the Hong Kong government condemned protesters who it said had “blatantly challenged the national sovereignty by maliciously besieging and storming” Beijing’s liaison office.
It promised to “deal with these acts in a serious manner in accordance with the law.
” A later statement denounced the attack at the train station, saying “some people congregated at the platforms” and attacked and injured commuters.
“This is absolutely unacceptable to Hong Kong as a society that observes the rule of law,” the statement said.
The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of China’s State Council also condemned the actions of the protesters who blocked the liaison office and vandalized it, and warned of serious consequences.
“Such acts openly challenge the authority of the central government,” the statement said, calling the actions “absolutely intolerable.
” The developments on Sunday were the latest chapter in the city’s  worst political crisis since China reclaimed sovereignty from Britain in 1997.
They signaled growing antagonism between the largely peaceful protest movement and the front-line officers patrolling it.
“I hope that the police can take reasonable actions tonight,” Roy Kwong, a lawmaker who has been a driving force behind the protests, told reporters at the front lines early Sunday evening.
“Otherwise, I fear that the anger of the people will erupt.
” The Civil Human Rights Front, which has helped organize the recent protests, said it estimated that 430,000 people had turned out for the officially sanctioned part of the march.
A police spokeswoman said that the estimated number of people who had marched along the permitted route during the “peak period” was 138,000.
The police also said that they were investigating whether explosives found Friday at a “homemade laboratory” were related to the Sunday protest, but that they did not have enough evidence to make any conclusion.
On Friday, the police said, officers seized about two pounds of powerful explosives, 10 gasoline bombs.
and bullets and knives from an industrial building.

89,1728138,"['American diplomats', 'Trump administration', 'Mr Maduro', 'mr guaidó', 'maximum mobilization', 'first time']","CARACAS, Venezuela — President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela faced the most direct challenge to his power Wednesday, when an opposition leader swore himself in as the nation’s legitimate president, cheered on by tens of thousands of supporters and a growing number of governments, including the Trump administration.
The fast-moving developments convulsing the impoverished country appeared to give momentum to the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, a 35-year-old politician who stepped onto the national stage just recently.
But Mr. Maduro dismissed the move, derisively calling it an American-led plot to overthrow him.
He said he was cutting all remaining diplomatic relations with the United States.
“I am the only president of Venezuela,” Mr. Maduro said, speaking from the balcony of the presidential palace in Caracas, according to Venezuelan news outlet Diario La Verdad.
“We do not want to return to the twentieth century of gringo interventions and coups d’etats.
” As if conducting an exorcism of the Americans, Mr. Maduro declared: “Be gone!” Mr. Maduro’s reaction came a few hours after Mr. Trump, in a White House statement, formally announced his recognition of Mr. Guaidó as the interim leader of Venezuela.
“The people of Venezuela have courageously spoken out against Maduro and his regime and demanded freedom and the rule of law,” Mr. Trump said.
Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Peru and the Organization of American States have also recognized Mr. Guaidó as the country’s leader.
While Venezuela state media ignored Mr. Guaidó and his supporters in the streets, there also was scant evidence of a large-scale repression of the opposition crowds by the police and armed forces, as has happened in the past.
As people in a downtown Caracas square converged and sang the national anthem, Mr. Guaidó declared before them: “Today, January 23, 2019, I swear to formally assume the powers of the national executive as president in charge of Venezuela.
” He told Venezuelans to raise their right hands as he said: “Let’s swear as brothers that we won’t rest until we gain freedom.
” He also told supporters to brace for a fight.
“We know this is not about just one person,” he said.
“We know this will have consequences.
” The opposition, after years of division, has largely united behind Mr. Guaidó.
He called for Wednesday’s protests, has offered to lead a transitional government and to hold new elections if Mr. Maduro steps down.
The demonstrations are part of a renewed push to oust Mr. Maduro by  Venezuela’s opposition, which was left largely powerless and divided after a burst of antigovernment activism in 2017 was crushed by security forces.
The opposition was hoping that a significant turnout on Wednesday would help persuade the nation’s military to break ranks with the president, which would be crucial to ousting him.
Opposition leaders hope the effort to oust Mr. Maduro, who was sworn in for a second term on Jan. 10, has a better chance of succeeding now because his government is collapsing under the weight of an economic crisis and is more isolated than ever.
The United States and many of Venezuela’s neighbors have called the president an illegitimate dictator and signaled strong support for a plan to establish a transitional government.
On Wednesday afternoon, soon after Mr. Trump made his announcement supporting Mr. Guaidó, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement saying the United States would “work closely with the legitimately elected National Assembly to facilitate the transition of Venezuela back to democracy and the rule of law.
” Mr. Pompeo urged Venezuela’s military and security forces to “support democracy and protect all Venezuelan citizens,” basically exhorting them to abandon Mr. Maduro.
“What we are witnessing is a unique, historic moment we have been preparing for, fighting for, over the past 20 years,” María Corina Machado, an opposition leader, said on Tuesday.
“Obviously, it is the moment of greatest peril for all Venezuelans and the moment of greatest responsibility for those of us who are aware of what is at stake.
” Mr. Maduro and his allies had called for rival demonstrations on Wednesday, accusing opposition leaders, whom he calls “terrorists,” of trying to sell out Venezuela to the United States.
Supporters of the government turned out, though the groups were much smaller.
Mr. Maduro asked the population for “calm, awareness and maximum mobilization.
” “Let’s defend our sovereignty,” he wrote Wednesday on Twitter.
“The streets belong to the people!” Iris Varela, a minister in Mr. Maduro’s government, dismissed the opposition leader’s actions on Wednesday as insignificant.
“Nothing is going to happen here,” she said in an interview.
“The National Assembly is contempt and their actions are void.
” As reports surfaced on social media of some government forces trying to suppress the opposition marches, the head of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, wrote on Twitter in Spanish condemning those actions.
He called the government response “repression by the usurper Nicolás Maduro,” and said the Venezuelan people “are demanding their freedom from tyranny.
” The National Guard — a branch of the armed forces — clashed with demonstrators in the Caracas neighborhood of El Paraíso, blocking their way and throwing tear gas canisters at some marchers.
Most shops in the city were shuttered, and many residents did not go to work.
“Maduro needs to go.
Simple as that,” said Ruben Grabados, a 71-year-old businessman, adding that he understood the risks of marching after the crackdown of the 2017 demonstrations that left more than 100 people dead.
“People die in Venezuela every day,” he said.
“It might as well be for freedom.
” Mr. Maduro may find it harder to weather this challenge to his legitimacy than he has in the past, analysts say, noting the growing international condemnation of his government and overt support for Mr. Guaidó.
“Brazil will provide political and financial support to the transition process so that democracy and peace return to Venezuela,” said Jair Bolsonaro, president of Brazil, on Twitter Wednesday.
Discontent has deepened across Venezuela’s socioeconomic classes as hyperinflation has rendered wages virtually worthless.
Citizens of what was once one of the region’s wealthiest nations have starved to death and died from preventable diseases.
More than three million Venezuelans have left the country in recent years, and those who stayed have struggled to find food and medicine while contending with water shortages and rampant crime.
Eva Golinger, an American lawyer who was a close friend  of the leftist strongman Hugo Chávez, Mr. Maduro’s mentor and predecessor, said the government could no longer count on its traditional bastions of support to overpower opposition movements, which in the past were led by wealthy and middle-class Venezuelans.
“The difference this time is that the discontent is not just opposition,” said Ms. Golinger, who wrote a memoir called “Confidante of ‘Tyrants,’ ” about her ties with Venezuelan and other leaders.
“In fact, it’s mainly poor people who are tired of going without basic products and earning decent wages.
” Other notable differences include the youth of the politicians now leading the quest to oust Mr. Maduro, and the careful messaging they have deployed.
The opposition’s new leader, Mr.  Guaidó, is a 35-year-old industrial engineer who was little known at home or abroad until this month, when he was sworn in as president of the National Assembly.
His appointment reinvigorated that opposition-dominated legislative body, which had become ineffectual and deeply unpopular in recent years.
“People had lost faith,” said Maria Amelia da Silva, 54, at one of the outdoor town hall-style meetings that opposition lawmakers convened in recent days to promote their plans.
“Then a leader emerged, and this new leader has become our biggest hope.
” Mr. Guaidó says  an interim government would distribute humanitarian aid, take steps to turn the economy around, and convene free and fair elections.
He has argued that doing so would not violate the Constitution because Mr. Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced as rigged, had “usurped” the presidency.
Past antigovernment demonstrations were dominated by rage and indignation, but Mr. Guaidó and his allies have tried to strike a hopeful, conciliatory tone.
They have taken pains to urge members of the military to abandon Mr. Maduro, arguing that doing so would constitute not a coup, but adherence to their oath to uphold the Constitution.
On Monday night, Mr. Guaidó and his wife, Fabiana Rosales, recorded video messages appealing to the consciences — and the aspirations — of members of the armed forces.
“None of you can live in a dignified manner on your military paycheck, you can’t meet the basic needs of your children and relatives,” Mr. Guaidó said.
“In the midst of this debacle, the people responsible for this crisis have forced you to clamp down and repress demonstrations of people who are only demanding to eat, to have access to health care, to have water at home, electricity.
” The town hall meetings, known as cabildos, have drawn thousands of people in recent days.
Speakers have fired up crowds by talking about freedom of the press, economic policy and the bleakness of the holiday season in Venezuela as more and more people have moved abroad.
“You can feel hope in the air,” said Annie Stone, a 63-year-old retiree in Caracas who wore a rosary with yellow, blue and red beads — paying tribute to the Venezuelan flag — to a recent meeting.
Referring to the youthful speakers, she added: “These aren’t superheroes that emerged overnight.
But for the first time, we see a solution in sight.
”
","CARACAS, Venezuela — President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela faced the most direct challenge to his hold on power on Wednesday, when an opposition leader stood in the streets of the capital and declared himself the legitimate president, cheered on by thousands of supporters and a growing number of governments, including the Trump administration.
Mr. Maduro responded furiously by cutting diplomatic ties with the United States.
He gave American diplomats 72 hours to leave the country, ordering them out with a derisive “be gone!” and accusing the Trump administration of plotting to overthrow him.
The United States said it would ignore the deadline.
The fast-moving developments convulsed Venezuela, a once-prosperous country that has been devastated by years of political repression, economic mismanagement and corruption.
But they also appeared to give new momentum to the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, a 35-year-old politician who stepped onto the national stage just recently.
Mr. Maduro immediately dismissed Mr. Guaidó’s claim to the presidency, calling it part of an American-led conspiracy to topple him.
Demonstrating his continued grip on power, he signed an order expelling American diplomats on the balcony of the presidential palace.
“I am the only president of Venezuela,” Mr. Maduro said.
“We do not want to return to the 20th century of gringo interventions and coups d’etats.
” Mr. Maduro’s reaction came a few hours after Mr. Trump, in a White House statement, formally announced his recognition of Mr. Guaidó as the interim leader of Venezuela.
“The people of Venezuela have courageously spoken out against Maduro and his regime and demanded freedom and the rule of law,” Mr. Trump said.
A senior American official briefing reporters in Washington warned that if Mr. Maduro used force against opponents, the United States could impose new sanctions, and did not rule out the use of military force to stop him.
It was not the first time the Trump administration has warned of a “military option” for Venezuela.
Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Peru, Ecuador, Guatemala and the Organization of American States have also recognized Mr. Guaidó as the country’s leader.
While Venezuelan state media ignored Mr. Guaidó and his supporters in the streets, there was scant evidence of large-scale repression of opposition supporters by the police and armed forces, as has happened in the past.
Still, the challenge to Mr. Maduro’s authority by Mr. Guaidó raised the possibility of violent confrontations, chaos and confusion in the days ahead.
Immediately after Mr. Maduro ordered American diplomats expelled, Mr. Guaidó announced that they could stay.
The American recognition of Mr. Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate president is far more than a symbolic measure, and presents new complications for Mr. Maduro.
The idea was avidly promoted by Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who pushed the Trump administration to take such a step.
In a speech to the Senate on Jan. 15, Mr. Rubio said that designating Mr. Guaidó as president would allow millions of dollars of Venezuelan government assets frozen in the United States to be at the disposal of opposition lawmakers, who could use them to fund new elections or humanitarian assistance.
The escalating showdown began with Mr. Guaidó’s declaration to an enormous crowd of supporters in a downtown square in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, on Wednesday.
As demonstrators sang the national anthem, Mr. Guaidó announced: “Today, January 23, 2019, I swear to formally assume the powers of the national executive as president in charge of Venezuela.
” He told Venezuelans to raise their right hands as he said: “Let’s swear as brothers that we won’t rest until we gain freedom.
” He also told supporters to brace for a fight.
“We know this is not about just one person,” he said.
“We know this will have consequences.
” The opposition, after years of division, has largely united behind Mr. Guaidó.
He called for the protests and has offered to lead a transitional government and hold new elections if Mr. Maduro stepped down.
The demonstrations are part of a renewed push to oust Mr. Maduro by  Venezuela’s opposition, which was left largely powerless and divided after a burst of antigovernment activism in 2017 was crushed by security forces.
The opposition was hoping that a significant turnout on Wednesday would help persuade the nation’s military to break ranks with the president, which would be crucial to removing him.
Opposition leaders also hope the effort to force out Mr. Maduro, who was sworn in for a second term on Jan. 10, has a better chance of succeeding now because his government is collapsing under the weight of an economic crisis and is more isolated than ever.
The United States and many of Venezuela’s neighbors have called the president an illegitimate dictator and signaled strong support for a plan to establish a transitional government.
On Wednesday afternoon, soon after Mr. Trump made his announcement supporting Mr. Guaidó, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement saying the United States would “work closely with the legitimately elected National Assembly to facilitate the transition of Venezuela back to democracy and the rule of law.
” Mr. Pompeo urged Venezuela’s military and security forces to “support democracy and protect all Venezuelan citizens,” basically exhorting them to abandon Mr. Maduro.
In a separate statement, he said the United States would defy Mr. Maduro’s order to have its diplomatic personnel leave the country, saying “we will conduct our relations with Venezuela through the government of interim President Guaido, who has invited our mission to remain.
” The armed forces have been a bastion of support for Mr. Maduro, who has nurtured their loyalty by giving officers lucrative contracts and assigning them to important government and state company posts.
Mr. Maduro and his allies had called for rival demonstrations on Wednesday, accusing opposition leaders, whom he calls “terrorists,” of trying to sell out Venezuela to the United States.
Supporters of the government turned out, though the groups were much smaller.
Iris Varela, a minister in Mr. Maduro’s government, dismissed the opposition leader’s actions on Wednesday as insignificant.
“Nothing is going to happen here,” she said in an interview.
“The National Assembly is in contempt and their actions are void.
” As reports surfaced on social media of some government forces trying to suppress the opposition marches, the head of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, wrote on Twitter in Spanish condemning those actions.
He called the government response “repression by the usurper Nicolás Maduro,” and said the Venezuelan people “are demanding their freedom from tyranny.
” The National Guard — a branch of the armed forces — clashed with demonstrators in the Caracas neighborhood of El Paraíso, blocking their way and throwing tear gas canisters at some marchers.
Most shops in the city were shuttered, and many residents did not go to work.
The Associated Press reported that at least seven people were killed in protests across the country.
“Maduro needs to go.
Simple as that,” said Ruben Grabados, a 71-year-old businessman, adding that he understood the risks of marching after the 2017 crackdown on demonstrations that left more than 100 people dead.
“People die in Venezuela every day,” he said.
“It might as well be for freedom.
” Mr. Maduro may find it harder to weather this challenge to his legitimacy than he has in the past, analysts say, noting the growing international condemnation of his government and overt support for Mr. Guaidó.
Discontent has deepened across Venezuela’s socioeconomic classes as hyperinflation has rendered wages virtually worthless.
Citizens of what was once one of the region’s wealthiest nations, endowed with plentiful oil, have starved to death and died from preventable diseases.
More than three million Venezuelans have left the country in recent years, and those who stayed have struggled to find food and medicine while contending with water shortages and rampant crime.
Eva Golinger, an American lawyer who was a close friend  of the leftist strongman Hugo Chávez, Mr. Maduro’s mentor and predecessor, said the government could no longer count on its traditional bastions of support to overpower opposition movements, which in the past were led by wealthy and middle-class Venezuelans.
“The difference this time is that the discontent is not just opposition,” said Ms. Golinger, who wrote a memoir called “Confidante of ‘Tyrants,’ ” about her ties with Venezuelan and other leaders.
“In fact, it’s mainly poor people who are tired of going without basic products and earning decent wages.
” Other notable differences include the youth of the politicians now leading the quest to oust Mr. Maduro, and the careful messaging they have deployed.
The opposition’s new leader, Mr.  Guaidó, is an industrial engineer little known at home or abroad until this month, when he was sworn in as president of the National Assembly.
His appointment reinvigorated that opposition-dominated legislative body, which had become ineffectual and deeply unpopular in recent years.
“People had lost faith,” said Maria Amelia da Silva, 54, at one of the outdoor town hall-style meetings that opposition lawmakers convened in recent days to promote their plans.
“Then a leader emerged, and this new leader has become our biggest hope.
” Mr. Guaidó says  an interim government would distribute humanitarian aid, take steps to turn the economy around, and convene free and fair elections.
He has argued that doing so would not violate the Constitution because Mr. Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced as rigged, had “usurped” the presidency.
Past antigovernment demonstrations were dominated by rage and indignation, but Mr. Guaidó and his allies have tried to strike a hopeful, conciliatory tone.
They have taken pains to urge members of the military to abandon Mr. Maduro, arguing that doing so would constitute not a coup, but adherence to their oath to uphold the Constitution.
On Monday night, Mr. Guaidó and his wife, Fabiana Rosales, recorded video messages appealing to the consciences — and the aspirations — of members of the armed forces.
“None of you can live in a dignified manner on your military paycheck, you can’t meet the basic needs of your children and relatives,” Mr. Guaidó said.
“In the midst of this debacle, the people responsible for this crisis have forced you to clamp down and repress demonstrations of people who are only demanding to eat, to have access to health care, to have water at home, electricity.
” The minister of defense, Vladimir Padrino, sought to reaffirm the military’s support of Mr. Maduro on Twitter, writing, “the soldiers of the nation do not accept a president imposed in the shadow of obscure interests or self-proclaimed at the margins of the law.
” But a National Assembly representative, William Barrientos of Zulia State, said in an interview that many officers had privately approached the opposition to express their desire for change.
“We have many, many lieutenant colonels, even many generals who haven’t been corrupted by the idiots who are governing this country, who have told us they are ready to defend the constitution, to defend the rule of law and the will of the Venezuelan people,” Mr. Barrientos said.

90,1782393,"['Russia', 'Chancellor Sebastian', 'Sebastian Kurz', 'freedom party', 'european union', 'snap election']","BERLIN — Austria’s far-right vice chancellor resigned on Saturday after a secretly filmed video showed him promising government contracts to a woman claiming to be the niece of a Russian oligarch in return for campaign finance, raising questions about whether Russia has a direct line to a government in the heart of Europe.
The video was the worst in a series of missteps that have threatened the stability of Austria’s governing coalition.
It has also raised concerns about whether Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache’s Freedom Party has been helping Chancellor Sebastian Kurz govern with an active agenda to undermine liberal democracy in the country.
The latest Austrian scandal comes at a big political moment in the European Union.
Across the Continent, far-right, populist leaders are campaigning hard before next week’s elections for the European Parliament and seem poised to increase their share in the chamber.
Many of Europe’s populists share the agenda of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia: fragmenting the Continent’s political landscape and weakening the European establishment’s power in Brussels.
Not long ago, these far-right parties were on the fringes of European politics, but like Austria’s Freedom Party, several are now part of coalition governments.
Some populist leaders, particularly in the Scandinavian countries and Poland, are wary of Russia, but others are outspoken in their desire for closer ties to the Kremlin.
The Freedom Party has longstanding ties with Russia and a formal cooperation agreement with Mr. Putin’s United Russia party.
The video of Strache’s meeting, which was filmed in a villa on the Spanish island of Ibiza three months before the 2017 election, exposed in a raw fashion Mr. Strache’s apparent eagerness to help Russia with unethical promises for government contracts in exchange for donations to his party.
Apparently filmed without Mr. Strache’s knowledge, the footage was obtained and published on Friday night by the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel and the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, two respected news outlets.
It appeared to have been filmed without Mr. Strache’s knowledge.
The New York Times could not independently verify the contents of the entire video.
The motive and the timing of the recording’s release remained unknown.
Der Spiegel has would not say how it had obtained the video, but confirmed that it knew the identity of its source.
But what is clear from excerpts from the video is the Freedom Party’s willingness to foster close links to Russia, even if in this case the meeting may have been a setup.
“The road to illiberal democracy — for some apparently a synonym for kleptocracy — was long planned,” Pamela Rendi-Wagner, the head of the opposition Social Democrats, said after the video was released.
“The video shows everything, says everything and provides deep insight.
” The footage shows Mr. Strache and a Russian-speaking Freedom Party official smoking and drinking while talking to a woman who claims to be the niece of a Russian oligarch.
When she offers to support the Freedom Party and invest 250 million euros, around $280 million, in Austria, Mr. Strache offers her road-building contracts in the country in return.
After resigning as vice chancellor and leader of the Freedom Party on Saturday, Mr. Strache played down his comments as “typical alcohol-fueled macho behavior” with which he had tried to impress the “attractive host.
” “I behaved boastfully like a teenager,” he said at a news conference in Vienna on Saturday.
But the video exposed an agenda that the Freedom Party had been actively pursuing — raising questions about the inroads Russia may have made in the government.
Vienna, some observers say, may be back at the center of a battle of ideas between liberal Western democrats and populist forces allied with Mr. Putin, who as a K.G.B. spy based in Communist Germany would go to Austria to ski.
“Vienna plays a key role for Putin and for the far right,” said Peter Pilz, an independent Austrian lawmaker.
“Far-right parties all over Europe have become a sort of fifth column for Russia.
In Austria, that fifth column has been in government.
” Mr. Strache first met Mr. Putin in May 2007.
In 2014, at least two Freedom Party members took part as election observers during the Russian referendum after the annexation of Crimea.
Then in 2016, seven months before the meeting in Ibiza took place, Mr. Strache traveled to Moscow to sign a formal cooperation agreement between the Freedom Party and Mr. Putin’s United Russia party.
Last August, Austria’s foreign minister, Karin Kneissl, who is backed by the Freedom Party, even invited Mr. Putin to her wedding.
And foreign intelligence services have stopped sharing sensitive information with Austria for fear that it may leak to Moscow.
But Chancellor Kurz has said that the links between the Freedom Party and Russia are overstated.
“Regarding the close contacts between Russia and the Freedom Party, I can only smile,” he said in an interview with The New York Times last month.
“Every Western foreign minister has more contact with senior Russian officials in one year than the Freedom Party in its entire history.
” For weeks, opposition parties have called on Mr. Kurz to end his controversial coalition with Freedom Party, whose well-documented links to far-right extremists and to Russia have increasingly worried allies at home and abroad.
The chancellor, who is expected to make a public statement later on Saturday, has so far resisted.
Mr. Kurz led his conservative Austrian People’s Party to victory in elections in 2017 by giving a youthful repackaging to much of the agenda of the Freedom Party, which he then invited into a coalition government.
He still depends on their support, but some analysts say the revelations in the video may make new elections inevitable.
At one point, according to the footage, Mr. Strache compared journalists to prostitutes.
He also said he would like Austria’s news media landscape to resemble that of neighboring Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban turned the country’s public media into a pro-government propaganda machine while allies have gradually bought up swathes of the private media sector.
“We want to build a media landscape like Orban did,” Mr. Strache says in the video, floating the idea of partly privatizing Austria’s public broadcaster and encouraging a suggestion by his Russian counterpart to take over Austria’s most influential tabloid.
“If she takes over the Krone newspaper three weeks before election and brings us to spot number one, then we can talk about anything,” Mr. Strache says.
Mr. Strache’s dismissive comments about journalists and casual planning to undermine Austria’s media freedom are seen as ominous.
Last year, an internal memo circulated by the press chief of the Interior Ministry, which is controlled by the Freedom Party, instructed officials to shut out critical news media and reward those that provided favorable coverage with access.
Since then, the party has proposed replacing the broadcast fee that Austrians pay the public broadcaster directly with a tax-funded model that would give the government more control over the outlet.
In recent weeks, a senior Freedom Party official has also demanded the removal of a television news anchor on Austria’s public broadcaster who had challenged him about a campaign poster that many said was reminiscent of Nazi propaganda.
In addition to openly nurturing its ties to Russia, the Interior Ministry has also raided its own intelligence agency, notably the department investigating far-right extremism.
And last month, a Freedom Party official wrote a poem calling immigrants rats.

” Elizabeth Warren said she would “persist.
” Amy Klobuchar has challenged voters to discount women “at your own peril,” while Tulsi Gabbard insisted that a presidential race with six women is not an anomaly but “what an election should look like.
” The women running for president are promising many things as they make their pitches to voters.
They are being asked repeatedly how being women may affect their chances.
But so far, none of them are emphasizing the “glass ceiling.
” In fact, the phrase “glass ceiling” was trending recently not because of anything the candidates had said, but because of Nike.
In an ad celebrating the World Cup-winning U.S. women’s soccer team, a narrator intones, over black and white imagery of the players, the “I believe” chant — completing it to say that women will “conquer more than just the soccer field, like breaking every single glass ceiling.
” The symbol remains intact.
In politics, the phrase became associated with the aspirations of Hillary Clinton, who spoke at key moments of success and defeat about cracking the glass ceiling.
But in this barrier-breaking field of female candidates, it is noticeably absent.
“Words have their moments, especially colloquialisms,” said the linguist Robin Lakoff, professor emerita at the University of California, Berkeley, whose 1975 book, “Language and Woman’s Place,” helped create the field of gender linguistics.
“Often, after a word or phrase gets a lot of use, people simply stop using it — because we like to sound original and this one seems tired.
” Which is not to say it is entirely verboten — or that metaphorical ceilings are not actually being shattered.
Kirsten Gillibrand tweeted the term month as part of a pledge for gender parity in national security, while Marianne Williamson notes on her campaign website that the “proverbial glass ceiling” is one of the things holding women back.
Aside from the record-breaking number of female candidates for president — along with those serving in Congress — there are more women CEOs in the Fortune 500 than ever before (though, of course, that number is still just 33), and a recent study published in the journal American Psychologist found that a majority of Americans believe women are just as competent as men — if not more.
“It’s a pretty dramatic shift,” said Alice Eagly, a social psychologist at Northwestern University who led the work, analyzing public perceptions over 70 years.
As a term, the “glass ceiling” dates to around 1978, when it was discussed by female workers at Hewlett-Packard and used onstage at a panel discussion about women’s aspirations by an employee of the New York Telephone Co.
Each used it to describe the inability of white-collar women to rise beyond the mid-manager level in their jobs, and the often invisible barriers preventing that rise.
The phrase gained traction in the mid-1980s, when it appeared in an article in Adweek (quoting the outgoing editor of Working Woman magazine) and then a headline in The Wall Street Journal (“The Glass Ceiling: Why Women Can’t Seem to Break the Invisible Barrier That Blocks Them From the Top Jobs”).
The New York Times ran an article in 1986 — the same year it proclaimed that, architecturally speaking, buildings made of see-through glass were “getting good reviews”— about the glass ceiling for female politicians, quoting Betty Friedan, co-founder of the National Organization for Women.
“Our women tried to go higher and I wonder whether they ran into a glass ceiling,” Ms. Friedan said then, recalling the unsuccessful campaigns of Carol Bellamy for mayor of New York, Elizabeth Holtzman for Congress and Geraldine Ferraro for vice president.
“In corporations, women get to a middle level and then there’s a glass ceiling — not overt discrimination, just a feeling that you can go this high and no higher.
” In the years following, the term continued to go mainstream — a kind of linguistic shorthand for a problem that could be difficult to pinpoint or describe.
By the 1990s it had been used to describe the experiences of Navy women, female lawyers, women in banking, older women, black professionals (women and men), women who worked on the campaign of George Bush and the plight of female journalists — as explained by The Washington Post’s board chair at the time, Katharine Graham.
More recently, it has been uttered by the likes of Priyanka Chopra, the actor Brie Larson (who this year played Captain Marvel in a rare female-led superhero film) and Madeleine Albright, who wore a glass-ceiling brooch to the Democratic National Convention in 2016.
Still, nobody has used the allegory quite like Mrs.
Clinton, who has for years talked about the “highest, hardest glass ceiling” she was determined to crack.
She spoke of it movingly in her 2008 concession speech, saying that while she was not able to shatter it, the ceiling now had “about 18 million cracks.
” Eight years later, when she became the first female nominee of a major party’s ticket, she leaned into the metaphor even harder.
When she spoke by video to the Democratic National Convention a virtual glass ceiling broke onscreen;
she accepted the nomination later in the week while saying, “When there are no ceilings, the sky’s the limit.
” And then, of course, there was the fateful night at the Javits Center in Manhattan, under a literal glass ceiling where confetti shaped like glass shards was supposed to rain from above as Mrs.
Clinton acknowledged victory.
“I remember thinking that the symbolism was going to feel so satisfying,” said Emma Gray, 31, who reports on women’s issues for HuffPost and remembers staring upward during a quiet moment at the Javits Center on election night.
“We were under a literal glass ceiling and that ceiling was going to metaphorically shatter.
And then it did not.
” The next morning, Mrs.
Clinton gave a concession speech and Google Search results for “glass ceiling” peaked, higher even than their previous peak during the Democratic National Convention that summer.
She noted somberly that while “we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling,” someone would, eventually.
With six women in the 2020 race, perhaps the phrase seems “almost a little bit embarrassing, or maybe just irrelevant,” said Ms. Lakoff, the linguist, adding that “of course it’s not.
” Which is not to say that the candidates are thinking about gender any less.
To the contrary, the less they talk about it the more it might indicate they’re actually thinking about it more.
“There’s a worry that if you draw too much attention to these biases, to your womanhood, that it reinforces people’s doubts about it,” said Adam Grant, an organizational psychologist at the Wharton School of Business, pointing to research from the corporate world that illustrated that point.
“So if I were a female candidate in this cycle, which I realize is a strange sentence to say, I would be afraid that talking about the glass ceiling would only reinforce it.
” And, anyway, there are other terms to play around with these days — such as “glass cliff,” to describe the phenomenon of women and minorities being tasked with leadership during periods of crisis, which was recently added to Dictionary.com.
(The “cliff” part is the idea that they’re being set up to fail.
) Or “motherhood penalty” to describe bias specifically against working mothers and “likability trap” to refer to the challenge female leaders face by having to prove they are tough and likable at once.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 29-year-old congresswoman from New York, has opted for “shake the table” and “build our own house” to describe breaking barriers, while Ayanna S. Pressley, the first black woman elected to Congress from Massachusetts, has noted that “When it comes to women of color candidates, folks don’t just talk about a glass ceiling.
What they describe is a concrete one.
” This time around, Ms. Klobuchar noted that the term itself isn’t just about winning the White House — it’s about running in the first place.
The number of women in the race is “a testament to the progress we have made,” she said.
“There are still barriers, but the highest and hardest glass ceiling has so many cracks in it, it is well on its way to becoming an outdated standard.

But in this barrier-breaking field of female candidates, it is noticeably absent.
[Sign up for In Her Words, a newsletter where women rule the headlines] “Words have their moments, especially colloquialisms,” said the linguist Robin Lakoff, professor emerita at the University of California, Berkeley, whose 1975 book, “Language and Woman’s Place,” helped create the field of gender linguistics.
“Often, after a word or phrase gets a lot of use, people simply stop using it — because we like to sound original and this one seems tired.
” Which is not to say it is entirely verboten — or that metaphorical ceilings are not actually being shattered.
Kirsten Gillibrand tweeted the term this month as part of a pledge for gender parity in national security, while Marianne Williamson notes on her campaign website that the “proverbial glass ceiling” is one of the things holding women back.
Aside from the record-breaking number of female candidates for president — along with those serving in Congress — there are more women CEOs in the Fortune 500 than ever before (though, of course, that number is still just 33), and a recent study published in the journal American Psychologist found that a majority of Americans believe women are just as competent as men — if not more.
“It’s a pretty dramatic shift,” said Alice Eagly, a social psychologist at Northwestern University who led the work, analyzing public perceptions over 70 years.
As a term, the “glass ceiling” dates to around 1978, when it was discussed by female workers at Hewlett-Packard and used onstage at a panel discussion about women’s aspirations by an employee of the New York Telephone Co.
Each used it to describe the inability of white-collar women to rise beyond the mid-manager level in their jobs, and the often invisible barriers preventing that rise.
The phrase gained traction in the mid-1980s, when it appeared in an article in Adweek (quoting the outgoing editor of Working Woman magazine) and then a headline in The Wall Street Journal (“The Glass Ceiling: Why Women Can’t Seem to Break the Invisible Barrier That Blocks Them From the Top Jobs”).
The New York Times ran an article in 1986 — the same year it proclaimed that, architecturally speaking, buildings made of see-through glass were “getting good reviews”— about the glass ceiling for female politicians, quoting Betty Friedan, co-founder of the National Organization for Women.
“Our women tried to go higher and I wonder whether they ran into a glass ceiling,” Ms. Friedan said then, recalling the unsuccessful campaigns of Carol Bellamy for mayor of New York, Elizabeth Holtzman for Congress and Geraldine Ferraro for vice president.
“In corporations, women get to a middle level and then there’s a glass ceiling — not overt discrimination, just a feeling that you can go this high and no higher.
” In the years following, the term continued to go mainstream — a kind of linguistic shorthand for a problem that could be difficult to pinpoint or describe.
By the 1990s it had been used to describe the experiences of Navy women, female lawyers, women in banking, older women, black professionals (women and men), women who worked on the campaign of George Bush and the plight of female journalists — as explained by The Washington Post’s board chair at the time, Katharine Graham.
More recently, it has been uttered by the likes of Priyanka Chopra, the actor Brie Larson (who this year played Captain Marvel in a rare female-led superhero film) and Madeleine Albright, who wore a glass-ceiling brooch to the Democratic National Convention in 2016.
Still, nobody has used the allegory quite like Mrs.
Clinton, who has for years talked about the “highest, hardest glass ceiling” she was determined to crack.
She spoke of it movingly in her 2008 concession speech, saying that while she was not able to shatter it, the ceiling now had “about 18 million cracks.
” Eight years later, when she became the first female nominee of a major party’s ticket, she leaned into the metaphor even harder.
When she spoke by video to the Democratic National Convention a virtual glass ceiling broke onscreen;
she accepted the nomination later in the week while saying, “When there are no ceilings, the sky’s the limit.
” And then, of course, there was the fateful night at the Javits Center in Manhattan, under a literal glass ceiling where confetti shaped like glass shards was supposed to rain from above as Mrs.
Clinton acknowledged victory.
“I remember thinking that the symbolism was going to feel so satisfying,” said Emma Gray, 31, who reports on women’s issues for HuffPost and remembers staring upward during a quiet moment at the Javits Center on election night.
“We were under a literal glass ceiling and that ceiling was going to metaphorically shatter.
And then it did not.
” The next morning, Mrs.
Clinton gave a concession speech and Google Search results for “glass ceiling” peaked, higher even than their previous peak during the Democratic National Convention that summer.
She noted somberly that while “we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling,” someone would, eventually.
With six women in the 2020 race, perhaps the phrase seems “almost a little bit embarrassing, or maybe just irrelevant,” said Ms. Lakoff, the linguist, adding that “of course it’s not.
” Which is not to say that the candidates are thinking about gender any less.
To the contrary, the less they talk about it the more it might indicate they’re actually thinking about it more.
“There’s a worry that if you draw too much attention to these biases, to your womanhood, that it reinforces people’s doubts about it,” said Adam Grant, an organizational psychologist at the Wharton School of Business, pointing to research from the corporate world that illustrated that point.
“So if I were a female candidate in this cycle, which I realize is a strange sentence to say, I would be afraid that talking about the glass ceiling would only reinforce it.
” And, anyway, there are other terms to play around with these days — such as “glass cliff,” to describe the phenomenon of women and minorities being tasked with leadership during periods of crisis, which was recently added to Dictionary.com.
(The “cliff” part is the idea that they’re being set up to fail.
) Or “motherhood penalty” to describe bias specifically against working mothers and “likability trap” to refer to the challenge female leaders face by having to prove they are tough and likable at once.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 29-year-old congresswoman from New York, has opted for “shake the table” and “build our own house” to describe breaking barriers, while Ayanna S. Pressley, the first black woman elected to Congress from Massachusetts, has noted that, “When it comes to women of color candidates, folks don’t just talk about a glass ceiling.
What they describe is a concrete one.
” This time around, Ms. Klobuchar noted that the term itself isn’t just about winning the White House — it’s about running in the first place.
The number of women in the race is “a testament to the progress we have made,” she said.
“There are still barriers, but the highest and hardest glass ceiling has so many cracks in it, it is well on its way to becoming an outdated standard.

93,1814923,"['United Nations', '90 percent', 'mr jawdat', ' found suitable', 'suitable work', 'american officials', 'camps', 'releases']","BEIJING — Senior Chinese officials made the surprising announcement on Tuesday that the authorities had released most detainees held in the government’s mass internment program for ethnic minority Muslims in China’s far west, but provided no firm numbers or specific details to support their assertion.
Alken Tuniaz, vice chairman of the government of the region of Xinjiang, said 90 percent of people held in what the government calls vocational training centers had been returned to society.
It was a contention that would be nearly impossible to independently verify in the tightly controlled region and flew in the face of accounts of disappearances and detentions that have been compiled by relatives abroad and human rights groups.
Detainees who have been released from the camps say they were subjected to a high-pressure indoctrination program with the goal of removing any devotion to Islam and encouraging loyalty to China and its ruling Communist Party.
The Chinese government’s public relations effort, made in a news briefing with regional officials, was the clearest signal that officials are trying to defuse international criticism over the internment in Xinjiang of as many as one million Uighurs and other ethnic minority Muslims.
“Presently, the majority of people who have undergone education and training have returned to society and returned to their families,” Mr. Tuniaz said, using the government’s official description of the camps as “education and training” centers.
“Most have already successfully achieved employment,” he said.
Shohrat Zakir, the chairman of the Xinjiang government, also said that as many as 90 percent of inmates at the camps had returned to society.
The officials’ ambiguous wording left room for uncertainty as to how much freedom can be exercised by inmates who have been released.
Though they did not detail the circumstances under which detainees were being “returned to society,” it is highly likely that many people supposedly released are in fact still under heavy restrictions or being forced to work at factories run under tight security.
Tahir Imin, a Uighur activist based in Washington, expressed skepticism at the Chinese officials’ suggestion that most detainees had been freed.
“Uighurs abroad continue to be unable to reach their relatives in the region.
No phone calls, no internet communications,” he said.
“We are not sure who they released.
” Mr. Imin urged the authorities to remove restrictions on the region and allow independent parties to verify the situation.
“If the Chinese government is honest and confident in what it’s saying to the media, it should allow people to communicate freely and go out of the country freely and allow independent media to visit and investigate freely,” he said.
He added that there were still many accounts of people disappearing across the region, including religious leaders, intellectuals, businesspeople and farmers.
“We have credible evidence and facts that show that only women, children and old people are left behind,” he said.
“Many young men and fathers are detained.
” The Chinese officials declined to say how many people were held in the camps or how many were released, arguing that the fluid conditions made it difficult to estimate.
They said the program of enforced indoctrination — which the government has said is aimed at curbing religious extremism — had been effective.
“These people have become a positive factor in society,” Mr. Zakir said.
Xinjiang is home to over 11 million Uighurs, a largely Muslim minority, and their treatment has become a global human rights controversy under President Xi Jinping.
Western governments, United Nations human rights experts, and advocates of Uighur self-determination have condemned the increasingly harsh restrictions on many Uighurs, especially their detention by the hundreds of thousands in re-education camps across Xinjiang.
Mr. Zakir is Xinjiang’s most senior Uighur official, and has repeatedly served as the public face defending Chinese government policies in the region, including the re-education camps, which rapidly expanded starting in 2017.
By contrast, Chen Quanguo, the more powerful Communist Party secretary of the region, has stayed in the background.
In October, party officials began to publicly acknowledge and defend the camps, many of which are large, prisonlike facilities behind walls.
In March, Mr. Zakir likened them to boarding schools where inmates — who include some of the most prominent Uighur intellectuals — also learn Chinese and useful job skills.
The Chinese government says that the camps and other sweeping security measures have extinguished bloody antigovernment attacks by Uighurs.
But critics say that the mass detentions of Uighurs and other Muslim minority groups are sowing bitterness that could be even more dangerous.
Earlier this month, a group of 22 countries, including Australia, Britain, Canada, France and Germany, issued a statement urging China to halt the mass detention of Uighurs and other Muslims.
China struck back with a letter signed by 37 ambassadors from countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America who praised its human rights record, including the “de-radicalization” policies applied in Xinjiang.
","BEIJING — Chinese officials said Tuesday that most of the inmates in re-education camps for Muslim minorities — a vast network of detention centers estimated to have held one million people or more — have been released.
But the United States, experts on Chinese policies, and ethnic Uighur Muslims abroad quickly contested the claim.
They said that there was no evidence of mass releases from the camps across the Xinjiang region in China’s northwest, and that people who had nominally been freed often effectively remained in captivity, including being forced into labor programs instead.
The State Department and the Pentagon, which have criticized China’s policies on Muslims for months, released the same long, forceful statement that said they were “unable to verify the vague claims” and that the Communist Party continued to show “extreme hostility to all religious faiths.
” The unexpected announcement in Beijing appeared intended to blunt growing international  condemnation of the camps.
It was made by two top officials in the regional government of Xinjiang, the northwest region where the Chinese Communist Party has set up the centers to hold Muslims, most of whom are Turkic-speaking Uighurs, and systems of electronic surveillance in towns and cities.
The officials indicated that most inmates had “returned to society.
” The World Uyghur Congress, a Munich-based group that campaigns for self-determination, dismissed the two officials’ claims as following “a predictable pattern of dubious statements.
” “Although there may be a kernel of truth to what we heard this morning, it’s so buried in deception that it becomes unrecognizable,” Dolkun Isa, the group’s secretary-general, said in a statement.
Western governments have grown increasingly vocal about the sweeping detentions in Xinjiang, a region in northwestern China.
Members of the Trump administration have taken up the issue and discussed imposing sanctions against officials who are involved, though the Treasury Department has privately recommended against the sanctions for fear of jeopardizing trade talks.
This month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, an evangelical Christian who talks about defending religious freedom, called China’s internment of Muslims “the stain of the century.
” The State Department and Pentagon said Tuesday that China should allow United Nations officials to have unmonitored access to all camps and all detainees, and let Muslims “freely travel away from Xinjiang and China to promote transparency.
” The American officials made clear that the camps were far from their only concern regarding China’s Muslim policies.
They denounced the surveillance systems outside the camps and the well-documented, government-run practice of ethnic Han Chinese, dominant in most of the country, staying uninvited in Uighur homes “to prevent the observance of Islamic practices.
” Separately, American officials say they are increasingly concerned about factories with forced Uighur labor that are linked to the detention centers.
Randall G. Schriver, an assistant secretary of defense, told reporters in May that the centers were “concentration camps” that held “at least a million but likely closer to three million citizens out of a population of about 10 million.
” Mr. Schriver did not say whether the three million referred to Muslims held simultaneously or whether it was an estimate of total detainees over a stretch of time, with some released during that period.
Chinese officials have depicted the camps as benign facilities that offer Chinese-language instruction and vocational training.
Alken Tuniaz, the vice chairman of the Xinjiang government, told reporters on Tuesday that “the majority of people who have undergone education and training have returned to society and returned to their families.
” He used the government’s official description of the camps as “education and training” centers and of their inmates as “students.
” “Most have already successfully achieved employment,” he said.
“Over 90 percent of the students have returned to society and returned to their families and are living happily.
” Both he and Shohrat Zakir, the government chairman, refused to say how many people have been held in the camps, which are often large clusters of buildings surrounded by fences and guards.
Official Chinese media accounts of the two officials’ comments varied, raising the possibility that they misspoke and their comments had to be drawn back.
Some cited Mr. Zakir as saying that 90 percent or more of people from camps had returned to society.
Others said, citing him, that 90 percent of those released had found suitable work.
Growing evidence from government documents shows the Xinjiang government wants to shift camp inmates and many other Uighurs into labor programs where they will work under the watch of the government and compliant factories, said Adrian Zenz, an independent researcher in Germany who studies the camps.
“They are basically now transitioning from internment to society-wide control,” Mr. Zenz said.
“They have a grand scheme now for controlling everybody, not just people in the camps but also putting those outside the camps into coercive labor.
” Gathering evidence to test the official claims of releases from the camps is likely to be difficult.
Foreign journalists are closely monitored and controlled when they visit Xinjiang, and independent investigators and human rights groups do not have free access.
Uighurs living abroad said they had not found evidence of widespread releases.
In interviews on Tuesday, two Uighur-Americans said they still had family members in detention.
One woman, Ziba Murat, a resident of Florida, said she still had not heard from her ailing mother, Gulshan Abbas, or a great-aunt, both of whom disappeared from their homes in Xinjiang last September.
“I think they are lying,” she said of the officials announcing mass releases.
Ferkat Jawdat, a resident of Virginia, said an uncle and aunt were still missing.
His mother, Minaiwaier Tuersun, was released in May, after being detained since February 2018, and suffers from severe health problems.
Her two younger brothers have also been released, he said.
But officials continue to monitor them in Xinjiang — and even Mr. Jawdat.
He said he was contacted by a Chinese man over a chat app who said he was an official and who warned Mr. Jawdat to stay quiet on the Uighurs’ plight or his mother would lose her freedom.
Tahir Imin, a Uighur activist based in Washington, said, “Uighurs abroad continue to be unable to reach their relatives in the region.
No phone calls, no internet communications.
” Xinjiang is home to more than 11 million Uighurs, more than the Pentagon’s estimate, and their treatment under President Xi Jinping has become a global human rights issue.
Western governments, United Nations human rights experts, and advocates of Uighur self-determination have condemned the increasingly harsh restrictions on many Uighurs.
Beyond describing them as vocational training facilities, the Xinjiang officials said the camps offered classes that have effectively inoculated Uighurs against the temptation to embrace religious extremism or terrorism.
Until several years ago, Xinjiang had experienced a string of deadly attacks by discontented Uighurs.
But former camp detainees who have left China say they were subjected to a high-pressure indoctrination program with the goal of removing devotion to Islam and instilling loyalty to China and its ruling Communist Party.
The Xinjiang officials’ wording on Tuesday left room for uncertainty as to how much freedom can be exercised by inmates who have been released.
Though they did not detail the circumstances under which detainees were being “returned to society,” it is possible that people released in name are in fact still under heavy restrictions.
James Leibold, an associate professor of politics at La Trobe University in Australia who has studied Xinjiang, said that factories are often linked to the camps, and that inmates assigned to work there live under heavy guard and monitoring.
“I find it highly unlikely, and frankly inconceivable, that the Chinese Communist Party would build this massive network of internment camps and then simply mothball them a couple of years later,” Professor Leibold said.
“Rather, the purposes of the camps were perhaps always meant to evolve over time, shifting from education to production, while their coercive, nonvoluntary and extrajudicial nature remains the same.
” At the news conference, Mr. Zakir, the regional chairman, also appeared to suggest that people from camps were being assigned factory jobs.
“You could say that maybe 90 percent or more,” he said, “have found suitable work to their liking with an impressive income.
” “These people have now become a positive factor in society, leading other ordinary people to create business and employment,” he said.
Mr. Zakir is Xinjiang’s most senior Uighur official, and has repeatedly served as the public face defending Chinese government policies in the region, including the re-education camps.
In October, party officials began to publicly acknowledge and defend the camps, many of which are large, prisonlike facilities behind walls.
In March, Mr. Zakir likened them to boarding schools.
Earlier this month, a group of 22 countries, including Australia, Britain, Canada, France and Germany, issued a statement urging China to halt the mass detention of Uighurs and other Muslims.
China struck back with a letter signed by 37 ambassadors from countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America who praised its human rights record, including the “de-radicalization” policies applied in Xinjiang.
The Chinese government’s assertion that the population in re-education camps is shrinking appeared intended to stave off debate about Xinjiang ahead of a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in September, as well as sessions of the United Nations Human Rights Council, said Sophie Richardson, the China director at Human Rights Watch.
But she said that there was no reason to believe the assertion.
“They lied about the existence of the camps.
They admitted the camps existed and lied about what happens inside them,” Ms. Richardson said.
“So one has to be awfully skeptical about a claim that — oops!
— it’s all sorted out.
” If there have been releases from the camps, that may also reflect the heavy costs on local governments across Xinjiang of operating and guarding the facilities, as well as a desire to put more Uighurs to work so that officials can meet the goals laid down by Mr. Xi to eradicate poverty by 2020.
Uighurs abroad continue to report new cases of relatives being detained.
Abdurahman Memet, a Uighur tour guide who lives in the eastern Xinjiang city of Turpan, was detained this month, said his nephew, Muharram Muhammad’ali Baqi, who lives in Japan.
The apparent reason for the detention was that he shared a letter from a relative who had been held in a camp with Mr. Baqi.
On Monday, Mr. Baqi said he received a call from a Chinese security official warning him that unless he stopped speaking publicly about the case, his family’s situation would worsen and his father, who is now in prison, would have no chance of release.
“But if I don’t do anything,” he said, “things may be worse.

Much of the investigation will focus on the so-called black boxes — voice and data recorders that were recovered on Monday.
• Several more airlines on grounded their Boeing 737 Max 8 planes on Monday and Tuesday, increasing to 23 the number of companies that have taken the aircraft out of service.
The Max 8, a new fuel-efficient version of Boeing’s most popular aircraft, has crashed twice in five months, leading to concerns about its safety.
• Boeing stands by the airworthiness of the plane but said that it planned to issue a software update and was working on changes to its flight controls and training guidelines.
Boeing is negotiating with the Federal Aviation Administration over improvements to its 737 Max 8 after the aircraft’s second crash in five months, though both the government and company insist the plane is safe to fly as is.
Since October, when a Max 8 belonging to the budget airline Lion Air crashed in Indonesia soon after takeoff, killing all 189 people on board, Boeing has been working on changes to the flight control systems of the aircraft.
The company has also been updating its training guidelines and manuals so that airlines can teach their pilots to fly the planes more safely and easily.
After the crash of Lion Air Flight 610, concerns arose about the aircraft’s flight control systems.
The main changes now being developed to those systems include limiting how much the plane’s computers can automatically pull down the nose of the plane if sensors detect a stall.
The concern after the Lion Air crash was that erroneous readings from poorly maintained sensors in the nose of the plane might have fooled the automatic systems into detecting that the plane was traveling sharply upward and in danger of stalling, when it was actually in level flight.
The automatic systems may then have forced the nose down significantly, sending the plane into a steep dive into the ocean.
Boeing issued a statement late Monday saying that since the Lion Air crash, the company had been developing a “flight control software enhancement for the 737 Max, designed to make an already safe aircraft even safer.
” According to the company, it has been working with the F.A.A. to roll out the software updates across the 737 Max fleet in the coming weeks.
As the list of airlines taking their 737 Max 8 aircraft out of service continued to grow, Singapore became the third country, joining China and Indonesia, to suspend all use of the plane.
Singapore’s decision on Tuesday will affect Silk Air, a Singapore-based airline with six of the planes, and four other airlines that operate the aircraft in the country.
The Federal Aviation Administration said on Monday that the plane was still airworthy, but many airlines have opted to ground the planes out of caution.
Four additional airlines — Aeroméxico, Aerolíneas Argentinas, Gol of Brazil and Royal Air Maroc of Morocco — took the planes out of service on Monday, bringing the worldwide total to
23. At least 16 airlines were still flying the jet on Monday, including Southwest Airlines, American Airlines and Air Canada.
Grounding a fleet because of technical problems is rare.
The F.A.A. hasn’t done it in the United States since 2013, when a problem with the Boeing 787’s battery system was discovered.
The flight data and cockpit voice recorders of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 were recovered on Monday, but the process of extracting the data contained within the so-called black boxes could be lengthy, experts cautioned.
The two recorders will need to be taken to a specialized center to read their data, said Lynnette Dray, an aviation expert and senior research associate at University College London.
“If the boxes are intact, then they will be able to take the data off them and look at it immediately,” Dr. Dray said.
American investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board were at the crash site near Bishoftu, Ethiopia, on Monday.
In a Twitter post, the F.A.A. said: “We are collecting data and keeping in contact with international civil aviation authorities as information becomes available.
”
","• The European Union suspended “all flight operations” of the Boeing 737 Max model that has crashed twice in the past six months.
The action came as more than a half dozen other countries grounded the plane, and was the most sweeping regulatory action taken so far in the two days since the crash of a Max 8 that killed 157 people on a flight from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to Nairobi, Kenya.
• President Trump had a telephone conversation with the chief executive of Boeing, who made the case that the 737 Max 8 should not be grounded in the United States, according to two people briefed on the conversation.
• Mr. Trump also said on Twitter that commercial airplanes had become overly technical, but said nothing about the Boeing Max models.
• At least 34 airlines have now grounded the Max 8, which means roughly two-thirds of the Max 8 planes in operation are now idled.
Boeing stands by the airworthiness of the plane, but said it planned to issue a software update and was working on changes to flight controls and training guidelines following the first crash, of a Lion Air flight in Indonesia last October.
[Read about how the airplane maker is dealing with the fallout from the crash.] • Pressure escalated inside the United States for a grounding of the Max 8, despite the Federal Aviation Administration’s declaration that the plane was considered safe.
• Boeing’s stock price, which fell 5 percent on Monday, fell 6 percent on Tuesday.
• Investigators from the United States and elsewhere are at the crash site of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.
Much of the investigation will focus on the voice and data recorders recovered on Monday.
The airline’s chief executive, interviewed by CNN, said the pilots had told air traffic control they were having “flight control problems.
” The European Union’s aviation regulatory agency barred flights of the Max 8, as well as a slightly newer model, the Max 9, joining several other regulators around the world, with the notable exceptions of the F.A.A. of the United States.
The action, which includes all flights over European Union territory, came as India, France, Germany, Britain, Ireland, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia and Oman joined China and Indonesia in suspending all use of the plane.
The European Union regulator, known as EASA, said the action included the suspension of “all commercial flights performed by third-country operators into, within or out of the E.U.” of the Max 8 and Max
9. The decision could disrupt travel not only through the heart of Europe but well beyond, as many commercial flight routes go over European Union territory.
Still, the extent of the disruption is unclear.
The grounded planes make up a relatively small portion of the flights zipping around the European continent.
Airlines and passengers will be affected as companies scramble to ensure that passengers can still get to their destinations, but the impact will depend on how much of their fleets are made up of the grounded planes, said Andrew Charlton, the managing director at Aviation Advocacy, an air transport consultancy based in Switzerland.
In the days since the crash, many airlines have opted to ground the planes out of caution.
The notable exceptions have been carriers in the United States and Canada.
Grounding a fleet because of technical problems is rare.
The F.A.A. hasn’t done it since 2013, when a problem with the Boeing 787’s battery system was discovered.
The pilots of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 reported to air traffic control that they were having “flight control problems” in the moments before the crash, the airline’s chief executive was quoted as saying in an interview with CNN.
The quoted remarks from the chief executive, Tewolde GebreMariam, suggested the plane had not responded to actions by the pilots.
Mr. GebreMariam was also quoted as saying the black boxes recovered from the wreckage “will be sent overseas” and not analyzed in Ethiopia.
He did not specify where they would be taken.
On Tuesday morning, Dennis A. Muilenburg, the chief executive of Boeing, spoke to President Trump on the phone and argued that the Max should not be grounded in the United States, according to two people briefed on the conversation.
A Boeing official said that during the call with the president, “Dennis reiterated our position that the Max is a safe aircraft.
” Mr. Muilenburg has worked to cultivate a relationship with the president, but it has sometimes been an uneasy one.
Shortly after becoming president-elect, Mr. Trump assailed Boeing for the estimated cost of its program to build new Air Force One planes, which provide mobile command centers for the president.
The “costs are out of control, more than $4 billion.
Cancel order!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter a month after winning the election, but before taking office.
A couple of weeks later, Mr. Muilenburg visited Mr. Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla.
, to try to smooth things over.
“It was a terrific conversation,” Mr. Muilenburg told reporters after the meeting, explaining that he had given Mr. Trump “my personal commitment” that Boeing would build new Air Force One planes for less than the $4 billion estimate.
Weeks after the conversation, Boeing donated $1 million to Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee.
The company had donated the same amount to help fund President Barack Obama’s 2013 inauguration.
Mr. Trump also publicly lamented on Tuesday what he described as excessive technology that has overtaken modern commercial jet travel and made it, in his view, more dangerous.
Without specifying Boeing or the Max 8, Mr. Trump said aircraft had become “far too complex to fly,” and recalled approvingly the era when pilots had total control in the cockpit.
“Split second decisions are needed, and the complexity creates danger,” Mr. Trump said in a pair of postings on Twitter.
“All this for great cost yet very little gain.
I don’t know about you, but I don’t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot.
I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!” Pilots and aviation experts have said repeatedly that flying is now safer than it has ever been.
The president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, Lori Bassani, said members were “very concerned with the recent Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash, which has raised safety concerns with the 737 Max 8.” In a statement, she said the association, which represents flight attendants at American Airlines, was calling on its chief executive, Doug Parker, to “strongly consider grounding these planes until a thorough investigation can be performed.
” While she did not say flight attendants would refuse to fly on the Max 8, “our flight attendants will not be forced to fly if they feel unsafe.
” American Airlines operates 24 Max 8s, making it one of the largest users of the plane in the United States.
Adding to the pressure for action in the United States, at least three senators joined the call for grounding the plane.
Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, and Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican and chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee’s aviation subcommittee, called on the F.A.A. to ground the aircraft while the cause of the Ethiopian crash is investigated.
Boeing is negotiating with the Federal Aviation Administration over improvements to its 737 Max 8 after the aircraft’s second crash in five months, though both the government and company insist the plane is safe to fly as is.
Since October, when a Max 8 belonging to the budget airline Lion Air crashed in Indonesia soon after takeoff, killing all 189 people on board, Boeing has been working on changes to the flight control systems of the aircraft.
The company has also been updating its training guidelines and manuals so that airlines can teach their pilots to fly the planes more safely and easily.
After the crash of Lion Air Flight 610, concerns arose about the aircraft’s flight control systems.
The main changes now being developed to those systems include limiting how much the plane’s computers can automatically pull down the nose of the plane if sensors detect a stall.
The concern after the Lion Air crash was that erroneous readings from poorly maintained sensors in the nose of the plane might have fooled the automatic systems into falsely concluding that the plane was traveling sharply upward and in danger of stalling.
The automatic systems may then have forced the nose down significantly, sending the plane into a steep dive into the ocean.
Boeing issued a statement late Monday saying that since the Lion Air crash, the company had been developing a “flight control software enhancement for the 737 Max, designed to make an already safe aircraft even safer.
” According to the company, it has been working with the F.A.A. to roll out the software updates across the 737 Max fleet in the coming weeks.
Share prices of Boeing, a major component of the Dow Jones industrial average, fell 6.1 percent during trading on Tuesday, following a similar decline Monday on worries about the spreading impact of the Max 8 crash in Ethiopia and the prognosis for future sales of the plane.
The flight data and cockpit voice recorders of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 were recovered on Monday, but the process of extracting the data contained within the so-called black boxes could be lengthy, experts cautioned.
The two recorders will need to be taken to a specialized center to read their data, said Lynnette Dray, an aviation expert and senior research associate at University College London.
More than 130 planes have been grounded worldwide in recent days, but there are hundreds more that have been ordered from Boeing, whose fates are now less certain.
Malaysia’s economic affairs minister said on Monday that the country’s sovereign wealth fund should review an earlier purchase agreement for 25 of Boeing’s 737 Max 8 planes, putting those orders in jeopardy.
Boeing’s 2016 agreement with Malaysia Airlines — an embattled, state-owned carrier — was valued at $2.75 billion at list prices and included purchase rights for additional 737 Max 8 and 737 Max 9 aircraft.
No other airlines have publicly questioned their orders of Boeing Max aircraft in the wake of the Ethiopian Airlines crash, said Shukor Yusof, the founder of Endau Analytics, an aviation consultancy based in Malaysia and Singapore.
On Monday, Dinh Viet Thang, the chairman of Vietnam’s Civil Aviation Authority, said that while the first Boeing Max planes were scheduled to be delivered in the country in October, they would not receive licenses for local use until the causes of the Max 8 crashes were identified and the F.A.A. took “proper remedying measures.

Under heavy rainfall, rescuers managed to bring 14 people to shore, the state news agency MTI reported.
Including passengers and crew, there were almost three dozen people on board the boat, the agency reported.
Boat traffic on the river was halted in the area of the capsizing, the Budapest Police Department said in a statement, after the authorities were notified about 9:15 p.m. that a boat had overturned.
The boat was struck by another vessel in the Danube near the Hungarian Parliament, and then tipped over and capsized, MTI reported.
Near the site, boats shone spotlights on the river, but after several days of rain, conditions were working against the search teams: The Danube was flowing fast and high, and winds hampered the search.
The teams were searching along the entire stretch of the Hungarian Danube south of Budapest, MTI said, and Interior Minister Sandor Pinter had arrived at the scene.
The news website Index reported that one person was rescued near the Petofi Bridge, about two miles south of Parliament.
A diving instructor, Zsolt Szamari, told Hungarian state television that several factors were impeding the rescue, including the weather, water temperature and the fast current of the Danube.
The boat was identified by The Associated Press as the Hableany, or Mermaid.
It was described on the website of its sightseeing company, the A.P. said, as “one of the smallest members of the fleet” and “an excellent venue for cruises and smaller family events.

","BUDAPEST — A boat capsized and sank in the Danube River in Budapest just before midnight on Wednesday, leaving at least seven people dead and as many as 19 unaccounted for, officials said.
Under heavy rainfall, rescuers managed to bring 14 people to shore, the state news agency MTI reported.
Speaking to reporters early Thursday, a representative for the National Ambulance Service said that seven people had died.
Including passengers and crew, there were three dozen or more people on board the boat, MTI reported.
According to the Foreign Ministry of South Korea, 33 South Koreans were on board the ship, on a tour of the Danube.
Seven of them were rescued;
seven were confirmed dead;
and the rest, 19, remained missing.
The ministry said it had established an emergency task force to learn more information from Hungary and to contact the victims’ families.
Very Good Tour, a company based in Seoul, South Korea, said that its customers, ranging from a 6-year-old girl to a 72-year-old man, were on the ship, along with a South Korean tour guide.
They were on a six-country tour of Eastern Europe that included visits to Croatia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Hungary, as well as a nighttime cruise on the Danube, the company said.
The tour company said the seven people who were rescued included a 60-year-old man and six women ranging in age from 31 to
66. It said the 33 South Koreans on board included 30 tourists, a tour guide who accompanied them from South Korea, and a local guide and a photographer, both South Koreans.
It said it was helping relatives of those who were on the boat travel to Budapest.
South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, ordered his government Thursday to mobilize “all diplomatic resources” to help assist the search and rescue operations on the Danube.
He also instructed the government to dispatch navy and coast guard divers from South Korea.
“Our government will have a thorough investigation of the cause of the accident in cooperation with the Hungarian government,” Mr. Moon said during a government meeting on Thursday, offering his “deep condolences” for the families of the victims.

96,1818974,['violent'],"New York City officials have carved out plazas for pedestrians in the middle of Broadway, a storied street where cars have ferried V.I.P.s in ticker-tape parades.
They have taken away more and more traffic lanes and parking spots to make room for bikes and buses.
Now, officials are taking their biggest step yet in making cars unwelcome on streets that they have ruled since they started rolling off Henry Ford’s assembly line.
Starting on Monday, cars will be all but banned from one of Manhattan’s main thoroughfares.
The busiest stretch of 14th Street — a major crosstown route for 21,000 vehicles a day that links the East and West Sides — will mostly be off limits to cars.
Drivers will be allowed onto the street for just a block or two to make deliveries and pick up and drop off passengers.
Then they will have to turn off.
The sweeping restrictions come as New York and other cities fundamentally rethink the role of cars in the face of unrelenting traffic that is choking their streets, poisoning the environment and crippling public transit systems by trapping buses and light rail systems in gridlock.
It is becoming a moment of reckoning — and, cars, which once had absolute hegemony over the streets, are losing.
“The idea of American cities got hijacked by the automobile,” said City Councilman Brad Lander, who supported a successful effort that got cars banned last year from Prospect Park, a lush, 526-acre oasis in central Brooklyn.
“There was a kind of romance about cars, and even in places like parks we allowed them to take over.
” Cities across the world are also seeking to take back their streets.
London has become the most famous case for congestion pricing — charging drivers a fee to enter clogged neighborhoods.
Paris has banned cars from the city center one Sunday a month and is rapidly expanding its biking network.
And Barcelona has reorganized some streets into “superblocks,” turning over the middle of the roadway to pedestrians and pushing cars to the edges.
Now New York, with 6,000 miles of streets, has effectively declared war on cars.
Earlier this year, it followed London’s example and became the first American city to embrace congestion pricing, reversing years of failed pushes.
And a proposal to raise tolls on tunnels and bridges leading into New York could add to the cost for suburban drivers.
But these efforts have provoked a strong pushback from critics who say the city has gone too far — turning cars into a convenient scapegoat for everything from poor urban planning to climate change.
“New York City is trying to make it so uncomfortable for drivers that they won’t drive anymore,” said Shelia Dunn, a spokeswoman for the National Motorists Association.
“It’s demonizing us.
Whatever is wrong, it’s the fault of the car.
” Even those who support the idea of a car-free city say the reality is that streets still revolve around cars and changing that balance will be complicated and messy.
“It’s a real tension,” Mr. Lander said.
“Not everybody has transit options.
A lot of people rely on their cars.
” A reliance on cars was encouraged during the era of Robert Moses, the powerful city builder who created a network of roadways from the 1930s to the 1960s that still crisscross New York.
But that view shifted over time as a new generation of city officials, urban planners and transportation advocates — motivated by gridlock and environmental worries — began radically reimagining the streets.
Pedestrian plazas debuted in 2008 under then-Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and have since spread to 79 places around the city, including replacing traffic lanes in the heart of Times Square.
Bike lanes have been expanded to 1,243 miles, including 480 miles that put barriers between riders and traffic.
Traffic signals have been recalibrated to give priority to pedestrians.
“Pedestrians went from being an impediment,” Bruce Schaller, a former city transportation official and consultant, said, “to being an honored guest who crosses first at intersections.
” Today, the soaring popularity of bicycling, an influx of newcomers, a thriving economy, the explosion of ride-hailing apps like Uber and a surge of delivery trucks carrying Amazon packages are strangling many communities.
As a result, cities like San Francisco and Seattle have focused on improving public transit systems, which can move far more people than cars.
“There’s a lot of urgency and demand to think creatively about how they manage their streets,” said Aaron Villere, a senior program associate for the National Association of City Transportation Officials.
New York’s effort to remove cars from 14th Street was inspired by a similar project in Toronto, where car traffic was blocking streetcars on one of the city’s vital thoroughfares, King Street.
“We really wanted to make transit function as reliably as it could for people,” said Barbara Gray, the general manager of Toronto’s Transportation Services.
So in 2017, the city restricted cars from driving across a 1.6-mile stretch of King Street, forcing them to turn off at the next intersection.
Soon streetcar speeds increased and service became more reliable.
Less than a year after the new rules were imposed, daily ridership rose to 84,000 from 72,000.
King Street has gone from the worst to the best transit corridor in the city, Ms. Gray said, and “people have been asking, ‘What streets are next?’” Still, some restaurants, stores and small businesses along King Street said they were suffering from a loss of customers.
In the past year, 17 restaurants have closed, according to the Ontario Restaurant, Hotel and Motel Association.
“It’s a ghost town down here — if that’s a success, I don’t know how,” said Al Carbone, the owner of the Kit Kat Italian Bar and Grill.
Mr. Carbone said his bar has lost between 10 percent and 30 percent of its business.
“People want convenience,” he said.
“They don’t want to park five blocks away.
” In New York, buses on 14th Street have slowed to a crawl of an average of 4.5 miles per hour, among the slowest of any American city.
Daily bus ridership has fallen to 28,000 from 38,000 in the past decade.
“Everybody complains,” said Larissa Krause, 63, who lives on the Lower East Side, and has stood out in the cold and rain waiting for buses that can take 30 to 40 minutes to show up.
The limits on cars grew out of the planned shutdown of the L train, which travels between Brooklyn and Manhattan, for repairs.
A fleet of buses was to have been deployed to carry displaced riders.
Though the shutdown was averted after transit officials opted to make repairs largely on nights and weekends, the city decided to go ahead with the car restrictions.
Polly Trottenberg, the city’s transportation commissioner, said New York needed to do more to encourage people to take public transit.
“As the city has continued to grow, we have seen incredible competition for the streets,” she said.
“Dedicated bus lanes are among the best ways to use that space as efficiently as possible.
” Still, some opponents have tried to stop the impending car restrictions.
A group of block associations sued the city over the new rules on 14th Street, saying that diverting car traffic would hurt the quality of life in the surrounding neighborhoods of Greenwich Village, Chelsea and the Flatiron.
The rules were briefly blocked by a judge, but allowed to go forward after a hearing on Aug.
6. “Basically the L train was just an excuse — they wanted to get rid of cars,” said Judy Pesin, 67, whose block association was part of the lawsuit.
She lives close to 14th Street and worries that car traffic, along with noise and pollution, will be shifted to surrounding streets.
“It’s about the commuters and not the community.
” Cars — including taxis and those working for ride-hailing apps — will be banned from driving across a one-mile stretch of 14th Street from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., seven days a week, under an 18-month pilot program that could be made permanent.
Drivers will have to turn right off the street at the first opportunity.
No left turns will be permitted.
Curbside parking spots have been replaced by loading zones.
Drivers who ignore the new restrictions could be issued tickets with fines starting at $50.
(Trucks and emergency vehicles will still be allowed.) Ms. Trottenberg said traffic in the area will be monitored and the rules could be adjusted if necessary.
Along 14th Street, lanes have been painted red and designated for buses and trucks only.
Paul Scheuring, 40, a security consultant who lives in the Bronx, complained that his drive to work will get longer because he will not be able to take the quickest route across 14th Street.
“I think it’s horrible,” he said.
“There are too many regulations being imposed.
” Local merchants have also criticized the changes.
One parking garage on 14th Street has handed out maps showing drivers how to access the garage.
“It’s bad for everybody,” said Luis Cabal, 63, a parking attendant.
“Business is going to go down.
” Amol Patil, the manager of Namaste Bookshop, said he has already lost customers after some curbside parking was turned into a bus lane.
But many bus riders along 14th Street said they could not wait for the change.
“I love it — it’s going to get me from A to B faster,” said Elba Casillas,
51. Joseph Cutrufo, a spokesman for Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group, said restricting cars from 14th Street was a bold move whose time has come and should be replicated elsewhere.
“We’re working to build streets for people — and people come first,” he said.
“You’re still welcome to come to 14th Street, just don’t bring your car.

• A 28-year-old man from Australia was charged with murder and appeared Saturday morning in a Christchurch courtroom.
Court papers identified him as Brenton Harrison Tarrant.
The New Zealand police said he would face additional charges.
A second man, 18, was charged with “intent to excite hostility or ill-will.
” • Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said many of the people who died in the attacks were the breadwinners in their families, and that the government would help those who had been left without income.
• President Trump, who was cited in the manifesto as a source of inspiration, told reporters he did not see white nationalism as a rising threat around the world and attributed such attacks to “a small group of people that have very, very serious problems.
” He also said he had not seen the manifesto.
The attacker targeted the Al Noor Mosque in the center of the city and Linwood Mosque, about three miles away.
The country’s police commissioner, Mike Bush, said at a Friday evening news conference that 41 people had been killed at Al Noor Mosque and seven at Linwood Mosque, and that another victim had died at Christchurch Hospital.
David Meates, the chief executive of the Canterbury District Health Board, said that 48 people, including young children, were treated for injuries at the hospital.
Mr. Bush said Saturday morning that two of the victims were in critical condition.
The police said Friday that three men and one woman had been taken into custody, but Mr. Bush lowered the total number to three on Saturday morning, indicating that someone had been released.
Ms. Ardern said none of those detained had been on security watch lists.
Mr. Bush had earlier urged people not to go to mosques anywhere in New Zealand on Friday.
He also urged mosques nationally to “close your doors until you hear from us again.
” In a Christchurch courtroom hearing closed to the public for security reasons, police officers in bulletproof vests brought in the suspect, Brenton Harrison Tarrant.
The police said he had been charged with one count of murder but would face additional charges.
Mr. Tarrant, 28, short with thinning brown hair, handcuffed and wearing white prison clothing, looked around the courtroom but said nothing as District Court Judge Paul Kellar ordered him held for a further hearing on April
5. Regional officials have said Mr. Tarrant is an Australian citizen.
Court papers listed his New Zealand address as Dunedin City, which is about 280 miles south of Christchurch.
Richard Peters, his court-appointed lawyer, said Mr. Tarrant had indicated he might represent himself in the prosecution.
Asked how Mr. Tarrant had reacted to what he is facing, Mr. Peters said, “He seemed to be quite aware of where he is and what he’s doing.
” At the same time the charging document for Mr. Tarrant was handed out to reporters, a second court filing was distributed that said Daniel John Burrough, 18, of Christchurch, had been charged with “intent to excite hostility or ill-will.
” Court officials would not elaborate on how the two cases were related.
In addition to Mr. Tarrant, three other people were arrested in connection with the attacks, although one was apparently released.
Few details have been offered about them.
A 17-minute video posted to Facebook shows part of the attack.
The clip, which appeared to have been taken from a helmet camera worn by the gunman, begins behind the wheel of a car.
A man, whose face can occasionally be seen in the rearview mirror, drives through the streets of Christchurch before pulling up in front of Al Noor Mosque, beside the sprawling Hagley Park.
[Read more here about the video, manifesto and social media posts.] He approaches the mosque on foot, his weapon visible, and begins shooting at people at the entrance.
What follows is a harrowing nearly two minutes of his firing on worshipers.
At one point the gunman exits the mosque and fires in both directions down the sidewalk before returning to his car for another gun — which, like the others, was inscribed with numbers, symbols or messages.
When he re-enters the mosque, he shoots several bodies at close range.
After another few minutes, he returns to his vehicle and drives away.
“There wasn’t even time to aim, there was so many targets,” he says at one point, as the sirens of an emergency response vehicle blare in the background.
Before the shooting, the gunman posted links to a white nationalist manifesto on Twitter and 8chan, an online forum known for extremist right-wing discussions.
The 8chan post included a link to the gunman’s Facebook page, where he said he would also broadcast live video of the attack.
The Twitter posts showed weapons covered in the names of past military generals and men who have recently carried out mass shootings.
In his manifesto, he identified himself as a 28-year-old man born in Australia, and listed his white nationalist heroes.
Writing that he had purposely used guns to stir discord in the United States over the Second Amendment’s provision on the right to bear arms, he also declared himself a fascist.
“For once, the person that will be called a fascist, is an actual fascist,” he wrote.
Many of the people who died in the attacks were the breadwinners in their family, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Saturday.
The victims were “predominantly from the ages of 20 to 60ish — and a large number of men,” Ms. Ardern told reporters at Hagley College, a local school near the hospital where relatives of the victims were gathering.
She said a government compensation system would help families of those left without income.
In the meantime, mosques would continue to get extra security, she added.
“The commissioner has advised that police security will continue at mosques around New Zealand until it is determined that it is no longer a threat,” she said, referring to the country’s police commissioner, Mike Bush.
Earlier in the day, Ms. Ardern vowed changes to the country’s gun laws.
She said that the attacker held a gun license obtained last November and that five guns were used in the attack, including two semi-automatic weapons.
“Our gun laws will change, now is the time,” Ms. Ardern said, though did not elaborate on what such legislation may look like.
“People will be seeking change, and I am committed to that.
” President Trump, who was mentioned in the suspected assailant’s manifesto as a source of inspiration, rejected suggestions that white nationalism is a rising menace, although he suggested it might be problem in New Zealand.
“I think it’s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems,” he told reporters in Washington in response to a question.
“If you look at what happened in New Zealand, perhaps that’s the case.
I don’t know enough about it yet.
But it’s certainly a terrible thing.
” Asked if he had seen the manifesto, Mr. Trump said: “I did not see it, but I think it’s a horrible event, it’s a horrible thing.
I saw it early in the morning when I looked at what was happening, and we spoke, as you know, to the prime minister.
I think it’s a horrible disgraceful thing, horrible act.
” Attacks on mosques and Muslim religious leaders in the West have increased in recent years, according to data from the Global Terrorism Database at the University of Maryland.
North America, Europe and Oceania saw 128 such attacks from 2010 through 2017, the latest year of available data.
Terrorist attacks on other religious institutions, such as churches and synagogues, totaled 213 over the same period.
Felix Kjellberg, a polarizing YouTube celebrity known as PewDiePie, distanced himself from the attacks after the man who filmed himself shooting victims at a mosque encouraged viewers to “subscribe to PewDiePie” in a video livestream.
“I feel absolutely sickened having my name uttered by this person,” Mr. Kjellberg, a Swede, said on Twitter.
Mr. Kjellberg has courted controversy by performing anti-Semitic gestures, which he calls satirical, in his videos.
He has a following of 89 million subscribers.
Over the last 18 months, tech companies have promised stronger safeguards to ensure that violent content is not distributed through their sites.
But those new safeguards were not enough to stop the posting of a video and manifesto believed related to Friday’s shooting.
A 17-minute video that included graphic footage apparently of the shooting could be found on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram more than an hour after being posted.
While Facebook and Twitter took down pages thought to be linked to the gunman, the posted content was spread rapidly through other accounts.
In order to evade detection, people appeared to be cropping the video or posting the text of the manifesto as an image — techniques used to evade automated systems that find and delete content.
Social media companies have heavily invested in those systems, with Facebook reporting last year that more than 99 percent of terrorism content by the Islamic State and Al Qaeda was found and removed through artificial intelligence.
A Facebook spokeswoman offered condolences to the victims and said the company was “removing any praise or support for the crime and the shooter or shooters as soon as we’re aware.
” YouTube said it had taken down thousands of videos related to the shooting, and asked users to help flag videos.
A spokeswoman for Reddit said it was also trying to remove “any content containing links to the video stream or the manifesto.
” Still, the tech companies were sharply criticized by Senator Cory Booker, a Democratic candidate for president, who said in New Hampshire on Friday that it was “unacceptable” for the companies to give “a platform to hate.
” Nasreen Hanif, a spokeswoman for the Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand, said the country’s Muslims were anxious for updates.
[For Muslims in New Zealand and abroad, the massacre has drawn outrage as a brazen act of hatred borne of anti-Muslim sentiment.
] Ms. Hanif said the two mosques in Christchurch had asked for help from the rest of New Zealand’s Muslims to arrange 49 funerals.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said that three Turkish citizens were wounded in the attack;
the Palestine Liberation Organization’s ambassador to New Zealand said at least one Palestinian was killed;
and the group Syrian Solidarity New Zealand said on its Facebook page that “Syrian refugees, including children, have been shot today.
” A site managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross listed dozens of people who had been recorded as missing, including people from Egypt, Syria, India, Kuwait, Jordan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Somalia.
Representative Ilhan Omar, one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, urged all Muslims to attend Friday Prayers and exhorted people of all faiths to join them to repudiate the white supremacist message of the New Zealand attack.
“I know there was a call for people to not go,” she told reporters after addressing a climate rally in Washington.
“But I said to people that is what the terrorists want us to do.
That is a win for them, and so we must face the hate and terror with love and with compassion.
” Ms. Omar also said “everyone should join us in solidarity.
” The New Zealand police force had called for mosques in the country to close.
The congresswoman, a freshman Democrat from Minnesota, has been at the center of a political tempest in the Democratic Party over remarks on Israel that critics have called anti-Semitic.
She has apologized for those remarks.
Members of the Bangladesh national cricket team, in Christchurch for a match against New Zealand, were en route to Al Noor Mosque for Friday Prayer when the shooting began.
They narrowly missed it.
Mohammad Isam, a journalist covering the team, reported for ESPN that at 1:52 p.m. he got a call from Tamim Iqbal Khan, one of the players.
“There’s shooting here, please save us,” Mr. Khan said, according to Mr. Isam.
At first, he thought it was a prank.
“But he hangs up and calls again — this time, his voice starts to crack,” Mr. Isam wrote.
“He says that I should call the police as there’s a shooting going on inside the mosque where they are about to enter.
” Mr. Isam ran toward the mosque and saw bloodied and dazed people fleeing.
In the chaos, he managed to find several players, and they eventually reconvened at the hotel.
The team manager, Khaled Mashud, told reporters that players were about 50 yards from the mosque.
“Had we reached even three or four minutes earlier, we probably would have been inside the mosque,” he said.
“Entire team got saved from active shooters,” Mr. Khan wrote on Twitter.
Another player, Mushfiqur Rahim, tweeted that he never wanted “to see this things happen again.
” Aman Singh, who works at a convenience store close to the Deans Avenue mosque, said he had heard the gunshots on Friday afternoon, and that shortly afterward people streamed past the shop, bloody and crying.
Mr. Singh, 26, said he knew several people who worshiped at the mosque.
“My really good friend goes there,” he said, adding that he had not been able to confirm the friend’s whereabouts on Friday afternoon.
Murders are rare in New Zealand, and gun homicides even rarer.
There were 35 murders countrywide in 2017.
And since 2007, gun homicides have been in the single digits each year except 2009, when there were
11. But there are plenty of guns.
There were 1.2 million registered firearms in the country of 4.6 million people in 2017, according to the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss nonprofit.
New Zealand law allows any person aged 16 or older with an entry-level firearm license to keep any number of common rifles and shotguns, according to GunPolicy.org, a project hosted by the University of Sydney.
Most guns can be purchased without being tracked by law enforcement officials.
A mass shooting in Aramoana, New Zealand, in 1990 — when a man killed 13 people, including two 6-year-olds, after a dispute with his neighbor — led directly to tightened gun laws, including restrictions on “military-style semiautomatic weapons.
”
","Forty-nine people were killed in shootings at two mosques in central Christchurch, New Zealand, on Friday, in a terrorist attack that appeared to have been carried out by a white extremist.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described the assault as terrorism and “an extraordinary and unprecedented act of violence.
” • Officials said a 28-year-old man had been charged with murder, and that two explosive devices were found attached to a vehicle that they had stopped.
The man’s name was not immediately released.
• A Muslim leader in New Zealand said the attack was especially shocking as it took place around Friday Prayer.
The police urged people to avoid the mosques.
• A gunman streamed a live video of the attack on Facebook, and appeared to have posted a manifesto online.

“Those views have no place in Australia, let alone the Australian Parliament.
” Sajid Javid, the British home secretary, said that Mr. Anning had fanned “the flames of violence &

98,1793437,"['pepper spray', 'movement', 'Hong Kong', 'wore sunglasses', 'surgical mask', 'communist party']","HONG KONG — Dragging heavy metal barriers, thousands of protesters poured onto roads around Hong Kong’s legislature on Wednesday morning to block access to the building in the latest demonstration against a contentious bill that would allow extraditions to mainland China.
The demonstrators, many of them young people in black T-shirts and wearing surgical masks, set up the barriers on a wide road outside the Legislative Council, as the sound of the metal scraping the asphalt ricocheted through a canyon of skyscrapers.
Hundreds of riot police, wearing full face shields and carrying batons, looked on.
The protesters were angered by the government’s refusal to back down on the extradition bill, despite mass protests on Sunday opposing the legislation and demanding that it be delayed.
Further inflaming tensions in the city was an announcement on Tuesday by the president of the Legislative Council, Andrew Leung, that lawmakers were likely to vote on the bill by the end of next week.
The demonstration on Sunday was largely peaceful, though some protesters clashed with police officers in the early hours of Monday.
On Tuesday, the city’s police force said members of the public should express their demands peacefully.
The South China Morning Post, a local newspaper, reported that thousands of additional officers had been mobilized.
At a briefing with reporters on Tuesday, police officials said they were prepared to deal with unrest.
“The force will not tolerate any kind of violence or the incitement of the use of violence,” said Kong Wing-cheung, a police spokesman.
On Tuesday night, several hundred people streamed into areas near the Legislative Council and government offices, with many of them huddling across the street, blocked by steel barricades.
Half a dozen police vans with flashing red lights parked near the protesters and riot police officers with helmets, batons and shields stood nearby.
Other protesters gathered on a landscaped pedestrian bridge and a waterfront, singing hymns and joining in prayers led by representatives of religious groups.
“We may be losing something precious,” Yip Po Lam, a Catholic priest, told the protesters.
“But I hope we will not leave behind our values and our persistence.
” [Why are people protesting in Hong Kong?
Catch up here.
] Mr. Leung, the president of the legislature, said he expected the bill to go to a vote on June 20 after a total of more than 60 hours of debate, adding that “the case is pressing and has to be handled as soon as possible.
” The measure is likely to pass in the local legislature, where pro-Beijing lawmakers hold 43 of 70 seats.
Opposition lawmakers had expected the vote to take place around the end of the month, based on a regular schedule of meetings.
Mr. Leung’s decision to add more sessions in the coming days in order to bring the date of the vote forward quickly drew criticism.
Billy Li, a barrister and representative of the Progressive Lawyers Group, said he was angered by the decision to accelerate the vote after what he described as a record-breaking demonstration on Sunday.
“The Legislative Council, as a body that regulates the government, not only failed to respond to the dissenting voices of the people but rather accelerated the situation,” Mr. Li said.
“It is not willing to allow the people to understand the case but is hastily forcing the public to accept it.
” The demonstrations on Wednesday were expected to be smaller than the march held on Sunday, in which up to a million people, or one-seventh of the territory’s population, paraded through the city in an overwhelmingly peaceful protest.
By Tuesday afternoon, labor groups, businesses and student organizations across the city had announced plans to demonstrate their opposition to the extradition bill.
Small businesses, including restaurants and bookstores, said they would close their doors;
high school students and as many as 4,000 of their teachers planned a walkout;
and a union for bus drivers urged members to drive well below the speed limit.
The Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong called the situation “extremely turbulent” and urged the government not to hurriedly pass the extradition bill “before adequately addressing the queries and worries of the legal sector and of the general public.
” An online petition called for 50,000 people to protest outside the Legislative Council on Wednesday, as the legislature prepared for its second debate on the proposed law.
On Tuesday, the council said it would restrict access to a nearby area that is typically reserved for demonstrations.
Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said on Monday that she had no intention of withdrawing the extradition bill despite the public outrage.
“We were doing it, and we are still doing it, out of our clear conscience, and our commitment to Hong Kong,” Ms. Lam told reporters.
The bill that has led to the protests would allow Hong Kong to detain and transfer people wanted in countries and territories with which it has no formal extradition agreements, including Taiwan and the Chinese mainland.
Ms. Lam has said the new law is urgently needed to prosecute a Hong Kong man who is wanted in Taiwan for the murder of his girlfriend.
But the authorities in Taiwan, a self-governed island claimed by Beijing, say they would not agree to the extradition arrangement because it would treat Taiwan as part of China.
Critics contend that the law would allow virtually anyone in the city to be picked up and detained in mainland China, where judges must follow the orders of the ruling Communist Party.
They fear the new law would target not just criminal suspects but political activists as well.
Willy Lam, an expert on Chinese politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the decision to accelerate the vote was probably made in the hope that it would bring a quick resolution and prevent public anger from building further.
“The government has good reason to hurry through the legislation in as short a time as possible,” Mr. Lam said.
Otherwise, it could face larger groups of residents united by their opposition to the bill, “by which time things might get out of control.
” But the Hong Kong government’s refusal to back down on the legislation or delay deliberations will hurt its credibility in the long term, Mr. Lam said.
“It will demonstrate that the administration is out of tune with public opinion.
” Katherine Li contributed reporting.
","HONG KONG — Riot police officers used pepper spray and water cannon against huge crowds of protesters who blocked roads around Hong Kong’s legislature on Wednesday morning, as lawmakers prepared to debate a contentious bill that would allow extraditions to mainland China.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators, many of them young people in black T-shirts, dragged heavy metal barriers into the road and flooded across lanes of traffic.
The scenes instantly recalled the start of the so-called Umbrella Movement protests of 2014, in which thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators blocked major Hong Kong thoroughfares for months.
Those protests, calling for more open elections in the semiautonomous Chinese territory, ultimately failed to win concessions from the Hong Kong government.
The city’s leaders said this week that they would press on with the extradition bill, despite an enormous march on Sunday opposing it.
“Hong Kong is a civilized city, but they don’t listen to the citizens,” said Grace Tsang, 25, one of the protesters.
She wore sunglasses and a surgical mask to protect herself against pepper spray.
With protesters thronging the area around the legislative building, officials said debate on the bill, which had been set to begin late in the morning, would be delayed, at least briefly.
Under the bill, people suspected of crimes could be sent to jurisdictions including mainland China, whose judicial system is subordinate to the ruling Communist Party.
The president of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council, Andrew Leung, said on Tuesday that lawmakers were likely to vote on the bill by the end of next week, a faster timetable than had been expected.
At a briefing with reporters on Tuesday, police officials had said they were prepared to deal with unrest.

Mr. Leung’s decision to add more sessions in the coming days in order to bring the date of the vote forward drew criticism.
Hong Kong’s stock market was down 1.5 percent around noon on Wednesday, as other markets in Asia saw little movement.
While some small Hong Kong businesses had threatened to close down for the day to protest the extradition bill, big international companies with a presence in the city have been largely quiet, apparently for fear of offending the Chinese government.
The public furor over the bill is the most dramatic sign in years of rising fear and anger over the erosion of civil liberties in Hong Kong, a former British colony that was returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Billy Li, a barrister and representative of the Progressive Lawyers Group, said he was angered by the decision to accelerate the vote after what he described as a record-breaking demonstration on Sunday.
Organizers said more than a million people participated.
“The Legislative Council, as a body that regulates the government, not only failed to respond to the dissenting voices of the people but rather accelerated the situation,” Mr. Li said.
“It is not willing to allow the people to understand the case but is hastily forcing the public to accept it.
” By Tuesday afternoon, labor groups, businesses and student organizations across the city had announced plans to demonstrate their opposition to the bill.
Small businesses, including restaurants and bookstores, said they would close their doors;
high school students and as many as 4,000 of their teachers planned a walkout;
and a union for bus drivers urged members to drive well below the speed limit.
The Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong called the situation “extremely turbulent” and urged the government not to rush the extradition bill through “before adequately addressing the queries and worries of the legal sector and of the general public.
” An online petition called for 50,000 people to protest outside the Legislative Council on Wednesday, as the legislature prepared for its second debate on the proposed law.
On Tuesday, the council said it would restrict access to a nearby area that is typically reserved for demonstrations.
Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said on Monday that she had no intention of withdrawing the extradition bill despite the public outrage.
“We were doing it, and we are still doing it, out of our clear conscience, and our commitment to Hong Kong,” Ms. Lam told reporters.
The bill would allow Hong Kong to detain and transfer people wanted in countries and territories with which it has no formal extradition agreements, including Taiwan and the Chinese mainland.
Ms. Lam has said the new law is urgently needed to prosecute a Hong Kong man who is wanted in Taiwan for the murder of his girlfriend.
But the authorities in Taiwan, a self-governed island claimed by Beijing, have said they would not agree to the extradition arrangement because it would treat Taiwan as part of China.
Critics contend that the legislation would allow virtually anyone in the city to be picked up and detained in mainland China, where judges must follow the orders of the Communist Party.
They fear the new law would target not just criminal suspects but political activists as well.
Willy Lam, an expert on Chinese politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the decision to accelerate the vote was probably made in the hope that it would bring a quick resolution and prevent public anger from building further.
“The government has good reason to hurry through the legislation in as short a time as possible,” Mr. Lam said.
Otherwise, it could face larger groups of residents united by their opposition to the bill, “by which time things might get out of control.
” But the Hong Kong government’s refusal to back down on the legislation or delay deliberations will hurt its credibility in the long term, Mr. Lam said.
“It will demonstrate that the administration is out of tune with public opinion.

Since then, they have become a  broader movement against Beijing’s power in this semiautonomous territory.
Over the course of several weeks, violent clashes between young protesters and the police have become more frequent, and the demonstrators’ demands have gotten more diverse and  ambitious.
Activists have stormed government offices, halted public transportation and defaced symbols of China’s authority.
And the police’s use of force against demonstrators, along with their failure to prevent a mob attack on train passengers, has made their conduct a central issue.
[Riot police officers clashed with anti-government protesters who crippled the airport on Tuesday for the second straight day.
] Here’s a guide to what prompted the protests, how they evolved and why it all matters.
Hong Kong, an international finance hub on China’s southern coast, was a British colony until 1997, when it was handed back to China under a policy known as “one country, two systems.
” The policy made Hong Kong part of China but let it keep many liberties denied to citizens on the mainland, including free speech, unrestricted internet access and the right to free assembly.
The territory has its own laws, system of government and police force under a mini-constitution known as the Basic Law.
China promised that this system would remain in place until at least 2047.
But many Hong Kongers feel that Beijing is already chipping away at its autonomy, and that the local government does its bidding.
The territory’s top leader, the chief executive — currently Carrie Lam — is appointed by a pro-Beijing committee.
And China’s security apparatus has made troubling intrusions into Hong Kong territory, including abducting booksellers and a Chinese-born billionaire.
In February, the local government introduced a bill in Hong Kong’s legislature, which is stacked with pro-China lawmakers, that would allow people accused of crimes to be sent to places with which Hong Kong had no extradition treaty — including mainland China, where the courts are controlled by the Communist Party.
Mrs.
Lam, the chief executive, argued that the bill was needed to guarantee justice for victims.
She said it was prompted by the case of a man who was accused of killing his girlfriend in Taiwan, then evading prosecution by fleeing to Hong Kong.
Critics say the bill would allow Beijing to target dissidents in Hong Kong with phony charges.

9. The discussion and demands changed on June 12, when the police used pepper spray, batons and more than 150 canisters of tear gas to disperse thousands of protesters, a small number of whom had thrown projectiles at the police.
The violence raised the pressure on Mrs.
Lam, and on June 15 she suspended the extradition bill, later calling it “dead.
” But she refused to withdraw it entirely.
Protesters consider that a half measure and have insisted on the bill’s formal withdrawal, as well as Mrs.
Lam’s resignation and an investigation of the police’s use of force.
Fueled by anger toward the police, as well as the slow erosion of civil liberties, the largely leaderless protests have morphed into a broader, more complicated movement: about protecting freedoms, democracy and Hong Kong’s autonomy.
The demonstrations have continued, and the vast majority of the participants have been nonviolent.
A peaceful march on June 16 was the biggest in Hong Kong’s history —  as many as two million people may have joined it.
But clashes between the police and young protesters in hard hats, masks and black T-shirts have escalated sharply.
Hundreds of demonstrators broke into the Legislative Council building in July, occupying it for hours and vandalizing it.
Later that month, protesters defaced China’s national emblem on the central government’s main office in the city.
That night, a mob of more than 100 men armed with rods attacked protesters and bystanders at a train station, injuring dozens.
The police were late to arrive and initially made no arrests;
some of the people later arrested appear to have ties to the organized crime groups known as triads.
The episode shocked the city and appears to have deepened anger toward the police, who have been accused of letting the attack happen.
The demonstrators have become more fluid in their tactics, moving from place to place around the city (“Be water,” a line from the late Hong Kong actor Bruce Lee, has become a rallying cry).
They have surrounded police stations, throwing bricks and lighting fires, and the police have ramped up their use of tear gas.
On Aug. 5, demonstrators held protests in various parts of the city, blocked trains and roads and called on Hong Kong people to stay home from work, which many apparently did.
Beijing has stood behind Mrs.
Lam and slowly ratcheted up its warnings to the protesters.
But Chinese officials have largely left it to her to quell the unrest.
Mrs.
Lam has refused to make further concessions since suspending the extradition bill, and she appears confident that her government can ride out the unrest.
On Aug. 5, she accused protesters of challenging Chinese rule, saying “they want to topple Hong Kong, to thoroughly destroy the livelihoods that seven million people cherish.
” She said the movement could push the city “to the verge of a very dangerous situation.
” A day later, Yang Guang, an official in Beijing’s office for Hong Kong affairs, gave China’s strongest warning yet: “I want to warn all the criminals to not wrongly judge the situation and take restraint for weakness.
” A “blow from the sword of law is waiting for them in the future,” he said.
But Mr. Yang did not say how Hong Kong, or China, might resolve the crisis.
Though the Chinese military hinted in July that it was ready to step in, local officials have denied that they planned to ask for military intervention, which the Basic Law allows.
President Xi Jinping has refrained from commenting publicly about the crisis.
The police have made hundreds of arrests, activists have added the release of prisoners to their demands, and the cycle of protests, clashes and disruption has no clear end in sight.

And the use of force against demonstrators, along with the failure to prevent a mob attack on train passengers, has made police conduct a central issue.
During the protests of Oct. 1, which coincided with celebrations marking the 70th year of Communist rule in China, police shot a teenage demonstrator.
It was the first time in months of protests that a live round was fired at a protester.
On Sept. 4, Hong Kong’s chief executive said she would satisfy one of the protesters’ central demands by withdrawing the extradition bill.
But it may not be enough to appease the protesters, who are now driven by multiple grievances with the government.

It was unclear, however, whether that decision would be enough to quell the protest movement, which over the summer developed several more ambitious demands.
Fueled by anger toward the police, as well as the slow erosion of civil liberties, the largely leaderless protests morphed into a broader, more complicated movement about protecting freedoms, democracy and Hong Kong’s autonomy.
The list of protesters’ demands has grown to include an independent investigation into the police response, amnesty for arrested participants and direct elections for all lawmakers and the chief executive.
The demonstrations have continued, and a vast majority of the participants have been nonviolent.

They have staged strikes, surrounded police stations, thrown bricks and lit fires, and the police have ramped up their use of tear gas, deployed water cannons and sent officers undercover among the protesters.
In August, the protests reached a new pitch: mass demonstrations briefly shut down air traffic at the Hong Kong airport;
as many as 1.7 million defied the police to peacefully march through the city center;
and street battles erupted around the city in the worst violence since June.
Beijing has stood behind Mrs.
Lam and slowly ratcheted up its warnings to the protesters.
In early August, for instance, Yang Guang, an official in Beijing’s office for Hong Kong affairs, warned, “I want to warn all the criminals to not wrongly judge the situation and take restraint for weakness.

Chinese officials, despite their increasingly strident warnings, have not said how Hong Kong, or China, might resolve the crisis.
Though the Chinese military hinted in July that it was ready to step in, Hong Kong officials have denied that they planned to ask for military intervention, which the Basic Law allows.
